If applications are the moat and high-perfomance is not necessarily a differentiator then we're basically saying that business development/ partnerships could be a key differentiator? If you could expand your thoughts on how these blockchains can build moats that would be helpful. Also, projects like Eigenlayer and Celestia should be no-brainers for long-term investment. But like L2s, their tokens are down only and tokenomics are basically lacking value added benefits. Most tokens have no use outside of governance. Are there any that stand out to you as different?As a future area of research, I would love to see a deep dive on the best tokenomics in the industry, consider value driving features and unlocks, inflation etc. Reply This comment is private and only viewable by group members. Your group enabling access: Everyone Muhammad YusufMar 24, 2025 • 11:18 PMThanks, Shanners. How chains can build moats and best tokenomics practices are great topics, and we will follow up with a piece on them soon. When it comes to utility beyond governance, I find some L1 tokens to be in an interesting spot. Sui and Solana for example have rent/burn mechanisms to allocate state and manage state growth but that isn't strong enough to push back on token unlocks. We'll look more into these. Reply",

Your group enabling access: Everyone Neel DaftaryMar 25, 2025 • 2:43 AMMegavault (27.6mn) is relatively small compared to HLP (297mn). Both vaults have seen massive outflows of capital over the last 3 months HLP down from 540mn and Megavault down from 80mn.Both receive a portion of the trading fees from the protocols along with the PNL from trading. It's difficult to benchmark the performance of these vaults against each other as the TVL deposited in both has been constantly changing over the last few months.But Megavault estimates annual pay based on the previous months returns annualised (which is -7% right now) & using the same methodology HLP estimate would be (-9.2% - No thanks to the Hyperliquid whale)I think the vault that outperforms is the one with more trading volumes over a long enough time frame. The protocol with more trading volume/TVL ratio gets to earn more from trading fees with the trading returns across both platforms converging over time unless the MMing strategy is significantly different (which I doubt it is).

The timeline is the same as twitter, as in like, for a single person, it doesn't matter if there are 40k or 5 million users bc the experience is roughly the same. Also the user demographic on farcaster is a higher value on average, lots of KOL type people. Farcaster probably does a better job of algo boosting signal from builder type people, almost like twitter did last cycle. Regardless, they stuff they are building there is really cool. Rn frames v2 is the biggest tailwind. On a longer time frame, I think capabilities of web3 social will be too much for web2 to compete with, but short term yeah Clanker may rely on ecosystem projects to expand its reach.

Report Summary Summarize Report Summary of “Story Protocol: The Roadmap for AI-Native Intellectual Property” The report explores Story Protocol, a specialized Layer-1 blockchain designed to address intellectual property (IP) attribution, licensing, and monetization in the AI era. As AI-generated content scales exponentially, traditional IP frameworks struggle to trace ownership, enforce rights, and distribute royalties. Story Protocol offers programmable IP licensing, on-chain attribution, and automated royalty distribution to create a more transparent and composable IP system. Key Takeaways: 1. The Problem with Traditional IP Systems Manual & Centralized: Legacy IP frameworks rely on centralized registries, slow enforcement, and expensive legal processes. Digital Rights Management (DRM) Issues: DRM tools restrict access but fail to track attribution or facilitate fair reuse. Crypto IP Projects Fall Short: Existing blockchain-based IP platforms, like IBM’s IPwe, tokenize ownership but lack licensing automation and derivative tracking. AI Disrupts IP Ownership: AI-generated content blurs ownership boundaries, making it harder to credit and compensate original creators. 2. Story Protocol’s Solution: A Dedicated Blockchain for IP On-Chain Attribution & Licensing: Story embeds ownership metadata, licensing terms, and royalty splits directly into IP assets. Programmable IP Licensing (PIL): Enables automatic royalty flows, derivative tracking, and revenue sharing for all contributors. Proof of Creativity (PoC) Protocol: Aims to validate originality and trace creative contributions across AI and human-generated works. Legal & Compliance Integration: Unlike “Code is Law” approaches, Story integrates real-world legal enforceability into its design. 3. AI-Native IP Economy: Key Innovations Cross-Chain Composability: Uses IBC (Cosmos), LayerZero, and Stargate to enable IP to move across blockchains. Chain of Intelligence: Ensures value flows back to original datasets, models, and contributors in AI-generated content. Agent TCP/IP: Introduces autonomous AI agents that can negotiate, license, and transact digital assets. IPFi (IP-Based Finance): Unlocks fractional ownership, IP-backed loans, and tokenized royalty derivatives. 4. Real-World Use Cases & Adoption Magma (Digital Art & Collaboration): Artists use Story to embed remix permissions, track attribution, and automate royalties. Mahojin (AI Model Attribution & Monetization): AI developers register datasets as IP assets, ensuring automatic revenue distribution for contributors. Web3 & DeFi Integration: Enables IP staking, licensing, and monetization across NFT and crypto ecosystems. 5. Challenges & Risks Legal Uncertainty: Crypto-based licensing is largely untested in global courts and must navigate complex jurisdictional differences. Adoption & Usability: Creators may prefer simpler, centralized alternatives unless Story offers clear financial and operational benefits. AI’s Existential Impact: If AI-generated content overwhelms attribution systems, Story’s framework may struggle to maintain relevance. Competition from General-Purpose Chains: Solana, Ethereum, and IBM’s IPwe offer less specialized but more widely adopted alternatives. Conclusion Story Protocol presents an ambitious vision for programmable IP infrastructure in the AI-driven digital economy. By embedding licensing, attribution, and royalties into blockchain technology, it offers a next-gen framework for managing and monetizing IP assets. However, regulatory uncertainties, adoption challenges, and competition from existing solutions will determine its long-term success. If Story can bridge AI, legal compliance, and crypto ecosystems effectively, it could reshape digital ownership and IP rights for the future. Why Story Protocol? Intellectual property (IP) management has historically been burdened by complexity, high costs, and reliance on centralized intermediaries. With the explosive growth of AI-generated content, these traditional inefficiencies now risk spiraling out of control, creating major challenges around attribution (crediting creators and tracing ownership), originality verification, and scalable, fair licensing. Story Protocol attempts a new approach designed specifically for the digital and AI-driven creative economy. It introduces programmable IP licensing, embeds on-chain attribution directly into the content workflow, and builds flexible licensing modules that make reuse and monetization easier and more accessible. Rather than launching as an app on an existing blockchain like Ethereum or Solana, Story has chosen the more ambitious path of building its own specialized chain. Although this decision comes with tradeoffs, including greater infrastructure overhead and adoption challenges, it also provides essential architectural control. Core protocol features, such as tracking how value flows through reused creative work, splitting royalties across multiple contributors, and embedding legal terms into licensing, require design choices that general-purpose blockchains aren’t built to natively support. General-purpose L1’s tend to prioritize broad use cases and standardized economic mechanisms, making it difficult to optimize for IP-specific workflows that involve tracing creative ownership across layers, managing complex royalty splits, or embedding licensing terms into assets at the protocol level. These workflows often demand specialized data structures, repeated computations, and native legal logic. General-purpose chains typically can’t support these requirements, as they rely on generalized computation, lack data models optimized for complex asset relationships, and don’t have legal enforcement tools at the base layer. Rather than over-indexing on the crypto ethos of “Code is Law”, Story strikes a thoughtful balance by recognizing that law carries greater real-world implications and enforceability—and by integrating that reality directly into the design of the system. This positions Story as a crucial bridge that implements real-world legal standards into crypto-native infrastructure, making it significantly easier for creatives and owners of proprietary IP to comfortably transition into blockchain-based systems. This report takes a closer look at whether Story’s architecture can deliver real, lasting advantages, and whether those advantages justify the complexity and ambition of building a layer-1 from the ground up. Along the way, we’ll evaluate Story’s positioning in the market, technical design, real-world use cases, AI integration strategy, and key risks that could limit its impact. Positioning for the AI-Driven IP Economy The proliferation of AI is beginning to overwhelm traditional IP systems. Largely shaped by slower, enforcement-heavy models, today’s frameworks often cannot keep pace with the machine-speed invention across both creative and proprietary domains. The core challenge is no longer just ownership, but how to trace contributions and distribute value at scale. Story Protocol positions itself as infrastructure for this shift, aiming to enable transparent attribution and automated compensation in an AI-native economy. A study of 1,018 scientists concluded that the researchers who leveraged AI produced 44% more breakthroughs in materials science and 39% more new patent filings, demonstrating this emerging technology’s growing role as a co-inventor of intellectual property. Undeniably, it’s positive for society that scientific breakthroughs are accelerating. But as AI becomes a co-author of research a difficult question arises: when new intellectual property is created in part (or entirely) by non-human entities, how do we decide which humans deserve credit and compensation? Story’s tooling is designed to help answer this question by enabling precise attribution across human and machine contributions alike. In a world where AI can independently invent or build on prior work, ensuring that foundational creators (whether they’re human or not) receive appropriate recognition and reward is more important than ever. Many argue that intellectual property and copyright will be driven into irrelevance by the unparalleled abundance that AI makes possible. In theory, if infinite variations of knowledge work can be created at near-zero cost, the idea of owning and enforcing IP rights (under the existing frameworks) begins to collapse. Although nobody really knows exactly how things will play out, what’s becoming clear is that we need new ownership models for this new age. Story Protocol enters a landscape dominated by three main categories of IP management systems. Despite their advantages, none can fulfill the demands of an AI-native economy in which composability is highly valuable. Traditional IP frameworks depend on centralized registries and manual, reactive enforcement that makes them unfit for fast-moving and collaborative digital content. Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems like Adobe’s and Marlin’s focus on restricting access and preventing misuse but don’t enable remixing, attribution, or automated royalties. Blockchain-based platforms like IBMs IPwe tokenize existing rights but lack support for programmable licenses, derivative tracking, and automated royalties. In contrast, Story offers a more adaptable and transparent framework, enabled by its cross-chain interoperability, which allows IP to move fluidly between platforms. This gives creators the ability to stake, license, and monetize their work across NFT, DeFi, and broader crypto ecosystems while keeping their assets registered to Story Protocol (conceptually similar to restaking in DeFi). Looking ahead, this infrastructure could also support a new layer of IP-based finance (IPFi). Features like fractional ownership, IP-backed-loans, and tokenized royalty derivatives rely on traceable attribution and Lego-like composability, which assets outside the Story ecosystem often can’t support. Story Protocol also aligns with the growing AI economy through its specialized agent integration framework, which enables programmable interactions between AI agents and IP assets. By building on broader technological shifts toward open-source, decentralization, and automation, Story positions itself to tackle emerging challenges in the AI-driven economy of intangible assets. Ghibli-fication and the Implications of AI Art As GPT-4o’s newly upgraded image generation sparks both excitement and outrage, it becomes increasingly clear why the infrastructure that Story Protocol offers could become essential. While many users have enthusiastically embraced GPT-4o’s ability to imitate distinctive art styles (like Studio Ghibli’s iconic aesthetic), the non-tech creative community has expressed profound ethical concerns. Some have criticized AI recreations of Ghibli’s style, echoing founder Hayao Miyazaki’s longstanding rejection of AI-generated art as “an insult to life itself.” These heated debates reflect deeper anxieties around intellectual property, the displacement of human creativity, and the ethical boundaries of AI-generated content. By making it easier to tell who created (and owns) what, and embedding usage terms directly into IP assets, Story is able to offer IP-focused businesses and creators practical tools to protect their work. Purpose-Built Infrastructure for IP At its core, Story Protocol is designed from the ground up to make rights enforceable and highly interoperable. Its infrastructure tackles the messy realities of IP licensing, covering everything from multi-party royalty splits and overlapping licensing relationships, to cross-chain asset flows and legally binding agreements. To pull this off, Story relies on a handful of specialized components that fit tightly together, as illustrated below. Although there are many parts to the architecture, these are some of the most important: Main Execution Core – An EVM-compatible environment that’s fine-tuned specifically for IP transactions Intellectual Property Core (IP Core) – Manages nuanced licensing processes and royalty flows with the help of 2 tools: Proof of Creativity Protocol (PoC) Programmable IP Licenses (PIL) Story Orchestration Service (SOS) – Bridges on-chain assets and activities with off-chain legal and financial systems Together, these pieces form the technical backbone that empowers Story Protocol to deliver programmable IP licensing tailored specifically to the complexities of an AI-native, composable, and compliance-ready ecosystem. Now that you can see what the architecture looks like from a bird’s-eye view, let’s take some time to more acutely understand how the different parts work. IP-Native Execution & Interoperability Story’s architecture is optimized to support highly unique and useful IP-native features like: Recursive licensing – licenses that carry terms forward across derivative works Multi-hop royalty flows – payments distributed through chains of contributors Composable attribution trees – attribution chains that are reusable, programmable, and extendable Even on faster chains like Solana, calculating royalties across multiple layers of derivative work usually requires application-specific code and repeated on-chain data calls. This introduces complexity and cost that general-purpose chains are not specifically optimized for. In contrast, Story handles these complex workflows natively at its base layer, enabling more fluid remixing, monetization, and attribution. To ensure these capabilities extend beyond its own chain, Story supports cross-chain interoperability. It uses Cosmos’s IBC protocol for native communication within the Cosmos ecosystem and leverages messaging protocols like LayerZero, deBridge, and Stargate for broader, multi-chain communication. These integrations allow IP assets to move between ecosystems, unlocking liquidity, composability, and licensing opportunities across DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and other crypto environments. Bridging Programmable IP to Real-World Systems To unlock the full potential of programmable IP, Story built a specialized core connecting IP assets directly with the off-chain world. In contrast to general-purpose oracles, the Off-Chain Synchronization Core specifically addresses the nuanced demands of IP workflows. For instance, when an independent artist licenses their digital artwork using Story, the Story Orchestration Service (SOS) is made to automatically verify their identity off-chain, link traditional payment channels for royalties, and generates off-chain legal licensing documents. Although the SOS presents a very valuable set of off-chain capabilities (identity verification, legal documentation generation, and payments integration), there doesn’t appear to be any public documentation explaining specifically how these features work. Until more details are available, it will likely be difficult for prospective users to fully trust these off-chain features without being in direct contact with the development team. With that in mind, the table below outlines how Story’s specialized oracle framework compares to general-purpose solutions across key IP workflows: This targeted approach becomes especially useful if one of your IP assets registered with Story is used beyond your specified terms. SOS can automatically gather the necessary off-chain evidence needed to generate enforceable claims. This makes detecting and resolving copyright infringement faster while reducing the manual administrative burden of building credible claims, pursuing litigation, or removing unauthorized content. Technologists tend to overestimate the capabilities of their creations, particularly when faced with real-world unpredictability. That said, the real MVP here is Story’s fusion of traditional oracle systems with automated processes, creating an experience that smoothly bridges practical off-chain needs and the integrated on-chain vision that crypto users expect. By automating these administrative complexities, Story can better handle the tidal wave of transactions that will be unleashed by AI-generated content, and enable both creators and businesses to focus more fully on creating, distributing, and monetizing their work. Proof of Creativity (PoC) & Programmable Licensing (PIL) Story’s heart beat and biggest chance at sustained differentiation comes from its Proof of Creativity Protocol and Programmable IP Licensing. As previously mentioned, traditional systems haven’t kept pace with the speed and complexity of modern knowledge work, especially with AI increasingly creating digital assets faster than humans can track them. PoC tackles this by embedding attribution, ownership, and licensing metadata directly into every asset minted on-chain. Storing metadata on-chain itself isn’t groundbreaking. But Story’s approach of tying these metadata records to automated and programmable licenses, is significant and unprecedented at the protocol level. The diagram below shows how Story’s various components work together step-by-step to ensure that registered assets remain clearly tracked and protected from the sea of abundance that AI-generated content introduces. What matters most about this approach are the practical implications: automatic royalty flows, transparent and auditable records, and licenses that enforce themselves without manual oversight. Partnerships with ambitious businesses indicate that Story’s value proposition is pragmatic and immediately useful, and not only a speculative bet on the future. But I’m still cautious. It’s still uncertain how courts will handle infringement claims that originate from Story, and whether Story’s dispute resolution and attestation services will prove to be both accepted and reliable, globally. Despite these uncertainties, Story appears to not shy away from the complicated nature of the business that they’re engaged in. If Story demonstrates clear and practical operational advantages, PoC and the PIL have a strong shot at becoming important pieces of the new property rights landscape shaped by AI. For now, they’re off to a strong start by solving a legitimate problem that many of their non-crypto competitors seem to be without a solution for. User Interfaces & Developer Tools Story Protocol’s success ultimately hinges on practical usability rather than technical elegance. To reduce friction for both developers and non-technical users, the protocol provides two complementary interfaces: Story SDK & IP Kit: The SDK offers low-level access to Story’s full IP licensing stack, while the IP Kit abstracts complex operations into a standardized, plug-and-play workflow. Similar to how Stripe enables small merchants to implement intuitive payment flows without managing payment rails, the IP Kit enables developers to offer creators a simplified and consistent interface for registering, licensing, and monetizing IP without having to build from scratch. IP Portal: A no-code interface that allows creators to manage their IP assets without thorough crypto expertise. This is especially important for onboarding artists, studios, and rights holders accustomed to traditional workflows. Here’s a screenshot of what the IP Portal frontend looks like: Even though Story’s interfaces have a clean and simple design, greater usability only matters to the extent that these tools align with real IP workflows. Collectively, the components described in this section form specialized, IP-native infrastructure that distinguishes Story Protocol from general-purpose chains or platforms. Today, people across crypto are calling for a shift in focus to building strong applications instead of a seemingly endless supply of infrastructure projects with hopes of pushing the industry into its broadband moment. With this in mind, Story makes a strong case that it’s not just building on the infrastructure-layer because it’s good for their valuation, but to solve a legitimate and growing problem. To more clearly understand the specific ways that some business models are “Only Possible on [Story]”, let’s explore a few case studies. Programmable IP in Practice Before we go into the case studies, here’s a brief overview of the general differences in user experience with, and without Story: The following two cases show how Story restructures creative and data-driven ecosystems, particularly in domains where existing IP frameworks fall short or are entirely absent. Magma – Protecting Artists, Powering Collaboration Problem: Digital artists struggle with ownership protection. Identifying and tracking creative provenance is informal, remixes go untracked, and payment depends on platforms (intermediaries) or manual licensing. Collaboration makes creative rights even more blurry. Solution: Magma uses Story to embed licensing terms directly into registered (and tokenized) work. Their 3 million users can set their remix permissions, standards for tracking attribution, and royalty splits that automatically execute when registered works are used. Impact: Artists now control how their work is used, and earn from derivative creations. They can confidently collaborate knowing their rights and earnings are protected by code, not just intermediaries’ policies. Mahojin – Transparent AI, Traceable Value Problem: In the AI ecosystem, data providers and model builders lack infrastructure to enforce ownership, trace reuse, or share in the monetization of assets they indirectly contributed to. Datasets are scraped and repurposed without attribution, excluding foundational contributors from value creation. Solution: Mahojin uses Story to register datasets and models as on-chain IP assets with embedded usage and revenue terms. When derivative (fine-tuned) models generate revenue, payments automatically flow through the contributor chain without manual coordination. Impact: Previously, datasets disappeared into black-box training pipelines without transparency or compensation. Now, Mahojin turns datasets and models into traceable, revenue-generating assets that create an enforceable value chain for collaborative AI development. Across these real-world examples, a consistent theme emerges: Story Protocol transforms fragmented, manual IP processes into programmable, enforceable systems. It automates attribution, simplifies licensing, and routes royalties without intermediaries—reducing the coordination overhead that slows down creative and data-centric economies. As AI-generated content and autonomous agents take on more of the production pipeline, IP infrastructure must operate beyond the limits of human coordination. The next section details how this model extends to AI-native environments, where the important information is not just tracked but embedded into the foundation of agentic workflows. Rethinking IP Coordination at Machine Scale Story introduces two ambitious, foundational mechanisms designed to coordinate IP in AI-native environments: the Chain of Intelligence (which encodes economic and legal relationships across datasets, models, and outputs) and the Agent TCP/IP (which aims to enable agents to license, transact, and enforce IP agreements without human oversight). Together, these systems represent an ambitious step toward a new form of machine-native IP infrastructure where value flows and rights enforcement are structured directly at the protocol level. However, we have yet to see the effectiveness of these mechanisms at scale. Chain of Intelligence: Attribution in AI Pipelines Generative AI systems increasingly rely on layered asset relationships: datasets feed into base models, which are fine-tuned into specialized models, which then generate outputs that may themselves become inputs to future systems. In cases like this, tracking and rewarding upstream contributors becomes both technically and economically complicated. Story attempts to address this by encoding usage rights and royalty terms directly into each asset. As derivative models or outputs generate revenue, the protocol automatically distributes payouts across the network of contributing assets. In doing so, Story systematically routes value back through the system, handling complex chains of attribution at scale. Example: Dataset A is used to train Model B. Model B is fine-tuned into Model C, which produces Content D. When Content D generates revenue, the protocol routes payouts to the contributors of Dataset A, Model B, and Model C according to the programmable licensing terms. Developers can register datasets and models using Story’s SDKs and APIs. The IP Portal also includes the Story Attestation Service, which compares prompts and outputs to previously registered IP. This helps flag potential misuse and ensures that IP owners and contributors receive credit and a proportional share of newly created value. To support these workflows at machine scale, Story plans to introduce an AI-optimized execution core specifically built to handle the computational demands of high-throughput licensing. Agentic IP Commerce: Tools for Enhanced Autonomy Story’s Agent TCP/IP is designed to give agents a powerful toolkit to negotiate licensing terms, handle complex transactions, and enforce agreements without needing constant human oversight. Agent interactions occur through structured, multi-round negotiations that are managed by smart contracts. Keeping the interactions in a standardized form makes it easier for the agents to iteratively propose, counter, and adjust license terms as needed. Throughout negotiations, agents mint license drafts to serve as on-chain records. This way, there’s a transparent audit trail that reduces ambiguity in detailed or lengthy licensing arrangements. In order to participate in the network, agents must stake $IP tokens and risk slashing or reputational penalties if they violate the agreed terms or wrongfully use assets that they are not cleared to interact with. These accountability mechanisms are meant to further align agent incentives toward compliant and trustworthy behavior so that the protocol retains its integrity and effectiveness even as agents exercise greater autonomy. Example: A weather forecasting agent uses Story’s framework to autonomously initiate licensing negotiations with a dataset provider agent. The dataset agent proposes initial terms that include upfront payment and ongoing royalties. Using Story’s negotiation tools, the weather agent responds by suggesting modifications to the royalty percentages and payment timing. At each stage in the negotiation, the agents record their requested licensing terms into clear on-chain drafts. Collectively, these drafts create a transparent audit trail that’s intended to simplify the management of IP asset interactions as they scale and become more layered. After reaching mutually agreeable terms, the finalized agreement is minted as a binding license token. When the weather agent monetizes its forecasts, royalties automatically flow back to the original dataset provider agent according to the agreed terms. The transparent negotiation history remains available on-chain. Compared to general-purpose chains, Story seeks to differentiate itself through deeper vertical integration of negotiation, coordination, and compliance capabilities. This kind of specialized architecture is very valuable in environments that rely on nuanced and iterative interactions between agents, particularly as direct human oversight becomes harder to scale. $IP Token The $IP token powers the Story Protocol ecosystem by funding growth, community initiatives, and contributor incentives. Over 58% of the initial 1 billion tokens are set aside specifically for these purposes. Tokens that are allocated for early backers and core team members will unlock gradually over a 40-month period, starting in mid-February 2025. Token Distribution: Stress Testing the Thesis Story Protocol presents an ambitious model for programmable IP infrastructure, though even strong designs face real-world frictions. To evaluate its true staying power, we need to stress test the thesis against the practical risks that could hinder its path forward. Legal & Regulatory Risks Story’s PILs offer an innovative approach to abstracting complexity from IP workflows, however innovation alone doesn’t guarantee legal acceptance. Crypto-based licensing remains largely untested in global courts, meaning enforceability is far from guaranteed. On top of that, conflicting legal frameworks across jurisdictions could make global adoption a lot more complicated. Additionally, patent-based and proprietary IP markets (like biotech or closed-source software) face ongoing legal uncertainties around how to determine inventorship when AI plays a significant role. Many regulatory bodies and patent offices around the world are still working out how to handle inventions or innovations in which AI has made a substantial contribution. These questions are further complicated by how differently jurisdictions approach emerging technologies like crypto and AI. For instance: Germany’s strict eIDAS regulations set high technical standards for verifying digital identities and electronic records. If German judges decide that certain blockchain records don’t meet the bar for verifiability under these rules, Story’s on-chain licenses could be unusable in infringement cases. This is especially problematic for patent-based IP that involves AI-generated innovations, where proving who invented something already has significant challenges. Singapore’s Payment Services Act, on the other hand, explicitly accommodates crypto transactions. This more progressive stance could make it easier for Story’s frameworks to naturally align with local business activity while staying legally compliant. This regulatory split illustrates how the same technology can glide through one market but run into serious barriers in another. While its permissionless design reduces friction, successful global scaling still depends on compliance with local regulations. For programmable licensing to gain widespread acceptance, courts, regulators, and IP rights holders will likely need clearer precedents and targeted education to build trust in these systems. Without those supports in place, Story could face cultural skepticism and operational delays that slow adoption and limit its near-term impact. The map below illustrates how global awareness and legislative action towards emerging technologies like AI vary significantly. AI-Specific Existential Risks The explosion of AI-generated content and innovation is creating serious challenges across the entire IP landscape. Whether it’s creative works or proprietary assets like algorithms, patents, or a scientific innovation, AI’s ability to generate new outputs at scale makes it harder to enforce rights and even harder to assign economic value. Story’s Proof of Creativity is designed to help address this by registering IP assets on-chain and systematically tracking their usage, derivatives, and monetization. But whether a system like this can operate reliably at the scale that AI demands remains an open question. If tracking the origin of an asset or assigning ownership becomes impractical or economically irrelevant, Story’s foundational value could be significantly compromised, casting doubt on its viability in an AI-driven creative economy. This challenge extends even further in domains like diagnostic tooling and pharmaceutical formulations where AI contribution blurs the boundaries of inventorship and originality. If courts ultimately decide that AI-generated inventions borrow too heavily from prior innovations (or cannot realistically be attributed to a human inventor), the economic value of patents and non-media IP could collapse. @lex_node’s post doesn’t just question the viability of IP law, it points to a more uncomfortable possibility: in an AI-dominated world, the foundations of property itself (intellectual or otherwise) may no longer hold in the way we’ve come to expect. Adoption & Integration Risks Story Protocol’s specialized design brings meaningful innovation, but it also introduces challenges around adoption and integration, especially given the complexity often associated with crypto-native systems. Compared to more familiar non-crypto IP registries and management platforms, Story’s programmable licensing and attribution tools may involve a steeper learning curve for some users. Without a highly intuitive user interface and a streamlined onboarding experience, many users may default to the relative simplicity of centralized solutions, regardless of technical and operations advantages. Another open question is how Story plans to handle infringement detection. It’s natural and common for new works to borrow elements or stylistic cues from earlier creations. If an artist produces something inspired by Studio Ghibli’s signature style, would that be flagged as infringement or simply seen as creative influence? The PoC is meant to help determine authorship and trace contribution, but it remains unclear how well the system can distinguish between fair borrowing and actual violations. Until the protocol proves it can navigate these nuances (especially within an automated framework) creators may hesitate to fully trust it. Many incumbent IP owners (successful artists, research labs, universities, etc.) tend to be risk-averse and rely on established systems. These individuals and institutions may hesitate to transition to less proven frameworks like Story without clear, tangible benefits. Unless Story can demonstrate measurable user benefits, like reduced costs or increased revenue, early stage adoption may face significant friction. Recognizing these challenges, Story has taken a more hands-on approach by actively incubating and supporting select ecosystem projects in the form of targeted mentorship, technical guidance, and go-to-market support. While this approach is not entirely unique among new L1’s, this intentional strategy aims to reduce onboarding friction and build stronger alignment between the protocol and its earliest users. Attention and liquidity are limited resources. If a chain wants to retain users and developers, it must cultivate projects that are uniquely suited to its infrastructure. The tweet below reflects this mindset and reinforces the idea that active ecosystem support is more effective than grand-funding alone. Competitive Risks Story has entered a landscape shaped by three entrenched models: traditional IP frameworks, digital rights management (DRM) systems, and general-purpose chains. All three offer familiar solutions, but none are built for the demands of an AI-native and remix-heavy economy. On the crypto side, higher throughput chains like Solana already have large developer ecosystems and can support “good enough” IP tools. Although Solana isn’t designed for programmable licensing or attribution, its scale and familiarity could make it an easier first choice, especially if Story’s stack feels too complex or unfamiliar to people. At the same time, legacy platforms like IBM’s IPwe and DRM systems like Adobe’s benefit from industry trust and robust legal integration. They lack support for remixability, dynamic licensing, or automated attribution, but their simplicity and institutional adoption makes them hard to displace. For Story to stand out, it needs to show why its approach is an essential innovation, and not just unnecessarily complex. If it can’t clearly communicate that value, its technical approach risks being seen as overly complicated compared to simpler alternatives. That’s why positioning, usability, and narrative clarity aren’t secondary concerns, they will determine whether Story can truly deliver on its ambitious promise. A Measured Bet on Story Protocol Story Protocol offers an exciting, forward-thinking vision for intellectual property management in an AI-driven, digital economy. Rather than extending outdated legacy systems, Story takes a bold leap by developing a specialized layer-1 designed to address modern IP challenges like attribution, royalty distribution, and licensing—areas where other solutions frequently fall short. Its innovative approach integrates legal compliance directly into the protocol itself, bridging crypto-native solutions with real-world IP enforcement in a technically thoughtful manner. Nevertheless, meaningful challenges remain. Opting for a dedicated chain involves inherent trade-offs, particularly around adoption, integration, and user experience compared to simpler and more familiar general-purpose platforms. Ultimately, Story’s architecture must convincingly justify these trade-offs by clearly demonstrating intuitive usability, genuine creator engagement, and tangible operational benefits. Despite these challenges, Story Protocol offers genuine reasons for optimism, especially because it aims to preserve the deeply human experiences and creativity that risk being swallowed by a vapid sea of unchecked AI-generated abundance. If Story can earn trust and gain meaningful traction within the ecosystems it seeks to serve, it could fundamentally reshape IP coordination—potentially becoming an essential piece of infrastructure that underpins a more human-centric internet of value. “Our enemies are all around us, and in so many futures they prevail.

Solana consistently outperforms competitors like Ethereum and Base in DEX volumes and transaction throughput. Median fees on Solana remain significantly lower than peers, highlighting its efficient architecture as avg fees rise. Validator income from MEV and fees surpassed issuance in mid-Nov, marking a pivotal shift in economic sustainability. 2. High-throughput chains are redefining blockchain infrastructure. Chains like Monad, HyperLiquid, and MegaETH push technical limits with parallelization and custom databases. Rollup designs like MegaETH achieve unparalleled speed but trade off decentralization. General-purpose chains aim for both performance and user experience. 3. Rollup ecosystems are consolidating around leading players. Base and Arbitrum dominate L2 TVL and user activity, accelerated by EIP-4844 implementation. Rollup fragmentation continues towards Base & Arbitrum. 4. Ethereum’s evolving roadmap lacks unified direction. Proposals like Native Rollups and Beam Chain aim to maintain Ethereum’s decentralization ethos. Challenges include aligning on priorities while improving scalability, gas limits, and block-building mechanisms. 5. Solana ecosystem innovation fosters a vibrant developer community. Projects like Firedancer and Anza enhance throughput and decentralization for Solana. Temporal introduces fee-based models as a fix to swQoS Solana fastest growing dev ecosystem. 6. MoveVM chains like Sui and Aptos emerge as Solana competitors. Sui introduces innovative object-centric transaction models, allowing for consensus fast-path. Aptos builds on original MoveVM principles, with growing ecosystems and liquidity. Both chains highlight increasing adoption in Asia and beyond. 7. Modular and appchain ecosystems gain momentum. Platforms like Initia and Movement integrate appchains and liquidity hubs for tailored experiences. Initia targets Cosmos-like interoperability, while Movement has a larger focus on their general purpose chain. Emerging appchains highlight the trade-off between ecosystem growth and operational complexity. 8. ZK rollups drive scalability with security. Starknet and zkSync lead with distinct approaches; Starknet focuses on Cairo, zkSync on EVM & Elastic Chains. Native rollups on Ethereum aim for deeper protocol-level ZK integration. 9. Modular ZK infrastructures expand. Projects like Bullet and Nil use ZK technology to enhance performance and decentralization. Polygon’s AggLayer fosters liquidity and cross-chain interoperability via ZK-backed systems. 10. ZK faces centralization challenges. Reliance on few zk proof vendors risks centralization, prompting Ethereum to diversify zk builders. Beam Chain and zkSNARK integration aim to secure scalability within decentralized frameworks. 11. Industry-wide focus on high-throughput scalability intensifies. Trends favor performant, general-purpose state machines like Solana over niche appchains. Centralized sequencer models enable unparalleled speed but raise questions about long-term decentralization. Performance competition remains a critical factor for dominance. 12. Infrastructure shifts signal broader implications for DeFi. DeFi TVL trends show a steady rise for Solana and competitors like Sui, challenging Ethereum’s dominance. Projects integrating AI, stablecoins, and advanced UX highlight blockchain’s broader use cases. Stablecoin liquidity and cross-chain interoperability remain critical growth areas. The Year Ahead for Crypto 2025 – Full Series: AI+DePIN DeFi Gaming Infrastructure Markets Blockchain/acc – Time to go Fast The industry is shifting to high throughput chains. This is not just about Solana, whose meteoric rise over the past year has led the thesis, but also alt L1s like Sui & L2s like Base who have surged in 2024, along with the numerous performant chains like Monad, HyperLiquid, Unichain, MegaETH and more all in the pipeline. Users have shown that the main thing they’ve desired to use blockchains for is a good UX on a single general purpose shared state machine. There’s really no better example of this than the recent AI meta. All of the activity is on Solana and Base. Not “AI focused” L1s like TAO, NEAR, or ICP. They are happening on two general purpose chains that have only aimed to create a shared state machine that can handle a lot of activity. Narratives will come to you if you can create this. Even Ethereum has recently started to raise its gas limit with a re-focus on L1 execution and is seeing new protocols designed to speed everything up. While people will debate the merits of appchains, so far we have not seen demand in practice outside of a few perp chains (Hyperliquid, dYdX), and while there are some interesting new L1s like Initia, Delta, Pod, Hyle and more that we will discuss later in the report, the next year is all about performant chains. Lastly, you should note that the chains in this section are a mix of L1/L2 and monolithic/modular. These constructions have different tradeoffs but are all trying to make the same thing: a fast shared state machine. The next sections will go over such chains. Solana High Throughput EVM: Hyperliquid, Monad, MegaETH, Unichain, Rise, Sonic, Ithaca, Nil, Berachain High Throughput SVM: Eclipse, Atlas, Soon, Fogo High Throughput MVM: Sui & Aptos Solana – Increase Bandwidth, Reduce Latency Solana Continues to Win While we have grouped the other chains into EVM/SVM/MVM buckets, Solana has been the trend setter in the performant chain thesis and stands alone with a big lead over the newer competitors (most of which haven’t launched). All of Solana’s metrics experienced rapid growth in 2024, and the introduction of so many new performant chains in the pipeline, is proof that Solana has been correct. When we wrote about Solana in the 2024 Year Ahead report it was only one month into what turned into a banner year. DEX volumes had just cracked $5B weekly, spiked to ~50% of Ethereum L1 and priority fees were just starting to see usage. Today? Not only are Solana DEX volumes now more than Ethereum L1, in November they were comparable to Ethereum and all L2s combined, and it surpassed Ethereum’s ATH DEX Volume of $118B from May 2021 (although below BSC’s $138B). This is even more impressive when you realize every L2 runs a single centralized sequencer that doesn’t need to participate in consensus (a process that inherently degrades performance). When compared to Ethereum volumes over the past two years, it is now on par or surpasses them monthly, and its dominance as a percentage of total DEX volume continues to climb, now accounting for nearly 1/3 of all spot trading volume on blockchains. This has, of course, led to an explosion in protocol revenue. For years the main critique against Solana was that fees were too cheap to sustain the blockchain. This was faulty logic as it ignored the convexity that fees exhibit when you create valuable state. Solana’s REV (total income from various fee sources) hit an ATH recently of >$25M in a week and is continuing to march up and to the right. This momentum has propelled Solana to both tracking and surpassing Ethereum consistently, although recently Ethereum came back ahead (h/t to Blockworks for the data). Make sure to play around with the date ranges on these charts to get a picture of the all-time and recent change. Also notable is that this hasn’t affected all fee paying users as it would with a global fee market. The median fee on Solana still stayed sub-cent during this period (votes, transfers, etc). Lastly, validator income from MEV and fees surpassed income from issuance for the first time ever in November. When we published “Solana the Monolith” in May 2023 this was nearly entirely issuance. There are calls for Solana to lower issuance further in light of this— keep an eye on this SIMD. With that being said, I don’t think issuance rate matters too much (it’s just a tax on non-stakers) and would refer people to this piece by Jon Charb if you disagree. The critique against Solana now is that this activity isn’t sustainable because it’s all memecoin trading. Listen, I get it, but this is once again adding qualifiers to any Solana metric that proves another old thesis wrong. The reality is this: Solana is the place to trade. Yes, it is dominated by memecoins now, but there is no reason why it will stay that way in the long-run, and if this is your main critique then I believe you are missing the forest for the trees. Memecoins aren’t any “less real” than other assets. The market trades what it wants to trade, and the fees paid to trade them are very real. I too hope we move past memecoins being the dominant assets traded but as of today that is just the reality, and they’ve become a good stress test for Solana. People will also compare Solana to chains like BSC, Fantom and Polygon that gained users when Ethereum gas prices spiked last bull, and then lost them during the bear. Again, this is a flawed comparison; Solana went through an explosion in activity all while Ethereum gas prices were 1-2 gwei. They were not pushed to Solana because of high fees elsewhere. Yes, low fees are an important part of Solana, but there’s way more to it than low fees. And while you can hate memecoins, it’s not like there was another meta out there that was gaining attention. If something new comes along and Solana doesn’t capture the volume, then we can say Solana has lost ground. If you need an example for why Solana is the place to trade, look at the recent AI meta. Agent AIXBT, an agent deployed on Base, had a significant amount of its volume traded on Solana. Solana users prefer it so much that they would rather trade a wrapped asset issued by a third party bridge (Wormhole) with much weaker security properties than use the chain where it was originally issued. We saw a more extreme example of this happen when Runes on Bitcoin were going through their hype. The top traded Rune had the majority of its volume on Solana, not Bitcoin or any other chain. Bitcoin is a terrible trading chain so it makes sense price discovery would happen elsewhere, but it’s notable that it’s Solana. Solana is simply the preferred destination to trade today. Even large Ethereum NFT projects like Pudgy Penguins have chosen to launch their token on it. Solana is simply an L2 to every other chain that issues assets. The main area where Solana still lacks is stablecoin TVL and by extension, volume. This is a metric you would want to see continue to rise along with other non-meme (DePIN, RWA, DeFi, etc) volumes in the years ahead as FOREX is the largest market opportunity in the world. Also, while users prefer Solana to trade, a lot of capital still prefers to use stables and keep assets on Ethereum as it is home to most of the best DeFi applications today. While Jupiter is the best spot trading app in crypto, the rest of Solana DeFi is still well behind their Ethereum competitors. There is still a lot of room for Solana DeFi to improve, however TVL has risen steadily from a year ago and now sits #2 at ~$10B after being outside the top 10 just 1.5 years ago. DeFi TVL also exhibits a sort of lindy effect. The longer people have assets in DeFi protocols the longer they will trust them, less likely they are to close out CDPs (and incur taxable events), and less likely to bear the operational overhead of moving assets. People continue to point to Ethereum vs Solana’s TVL as a knock against Solana. And it’s true, Ethereum’s is much larger, but this gap continues to move in one direction. If you used this argument a year ago when Ethereum had 40x Solana’s TVL, you would have missed this moving down to 7.7x. I see no reason why this multiple doesn’t continue to decrease over the next year. The most important question now is, how does Solana maintain this lead? If crypto is truly entering its high throughput chain era, then how will Solana fare with so many competitors coming after the king? The answer is simple, but not easy: increase bandwidth, reduce latency. How Solana Will Keep Winning One commonly used argument against Solana’s moat is that “there will always be a faster chain that comes along”. This is a bad argument to me, for a few reasons. SVM was a material improvement over EVM. Other VM’s may provide some improvements over EVM but less against SVM (specifically a parallelized VM with no token approvals). SVM is fastest growing alt-VM eco. Like Ethereum and EVM network effects, Solana is starting to exhibit the same. There are numerous new SVM chains we will discuss. This all creates a larger developer base. You can’t cheat physics. While centralized L2s with a single sequencer will be able to move faster than Solana, it is not clear if another globally distributed L1 can. With Firedancer, Anza improvements, and a ruthless dedication to IBRL, it’s hard to see Solana be outcompeted. Toly and the team have always stayed laser focused on their mission to be a globally decentralized NASDAQ; the thesis hasn’t changed. The ZK argument: ZK can’t speed up native consensus. Solana’s goal is to be the most performant single state machine, something ZK cannot help with. With all that being said, success is by no means guaranteed. Solana is far from perfect, still has a lot of issues, and there are a lot of worthy competitors approaching. Some key teams/initiatives for Solana are below. Temporal A research firm founded by ex-HFT, TradFi and MarginFi contributors (like Ben from above), Temporal looks to fix Solana’s fee markets. Their main priority is to replace swQoS with a fee based model (tl;dr is swQoS gives priority to amount of stake whereas fee market is simply fee paid). Their goal is to create a new transport layer for Solana replacing QUIC and UDP. They recently announced Nozomi, a new fee based way to land tx’s on Solana (only pay tip if your tx is landed first). This product exploits Durable nonces to create a better priority fee mechanism. The team has a lot of experience and understands the infrastructure and nuances deeply – they are one of the main infra focused teams to watch. Anza While Firedancer gets the hype, the team behind Anza should not be written off or taken lightly. It’s not like the Anza team is just going through the motions and maintaining Solana’s validator client until Firedancer comes. Anza recently released the Agave 2.0 client, with it some notable improvements/changes: Full priority fee now given to validators instead of burned Central scheduler now on by default. The new scheduler went live a few months back and looks to improve network jitter (full breakdown) A new ZK ElGamal Proof program and new syscalls A break from old labs client and moves Solana towards multi-client world And it’s not like Anza isn’t focused on IBRL. And they just got talent from Ethereum. Firedancer Frankendancer went live on mainnet in September. As of now they do not have Jito support so uptake has been slow. Once that is implemented expect the number of validators running it to increase significantly. The full client is running on testnet. You can watch a live feed of Superteam Germany’s validator here: https://fd-mainnet.stakingfacilities.com/ Jito The MEV backbone of Solana, Jito has become Solana’s most profitable protocol. All of the fee/MEV charts from above are attributable to Jito’s infrastructure. They recently released Jito Restaking which you can read more about in our Restaking report. As mentioned above, they are not yet integrated with Franken/Firedancer. Wallet Infra Solana’s wallet infra continues to improve with teams like Squads leading the charge. They recently introduced virtual US banks accounts, allowing users to send directly between onchain and offchain without a CEX. Asynchronous Execution An ambitious challenge, async execution allows validators to create blocks without executing them. There are numerous advantages to AE like shorter block times, lower validator requirements, faster finality, a pathway to MCP (multiple concurrent proposers) and more. A good breakdown can be found here by Helius. Mithril Created by the Overclock Validator team, Mithril is a Solana full node client that aims to make home verifiability plausible – one of Solana’s largest critiques. They recently reached a new milestone. New Ideas Replicated Elsewhere One clear signal of an innovative ecosystem is when its products not only succeed but are also replicated elsewhere. The main ones that come to mind here are Pump.Fun, MetaDAO and AI Agents Pump.Fun gets a lot of hate for being memecoin focused but pump just gave users something they wanted with standardized regulation (stopping rug pulls). Competitors like clanker.fun and wow.xyz have launched on Base MetaDAO was first to launch Futarchy in prod and is now being replicated on Ethereum AI Agents & platforms took off on Solana & Base, not “AI focused” chains DePIN & DeAI More on this in the DePIN & DeAI Year Ahead report, but Solana is home to numerous DePIN networks like Helium, Hivemapper, Pipe, Dawn, and Teleport, and it’s also leading the AI agent narrative, with other infrastructure projects such as grass Numerous SVM Stack Chains Eclipse, Soon, Atlas, Sonic and more are all building on the SVM stack, potentially increasing SVM network effects. ZK & Modularity For the full breakdown just skip to the ZK deep dive part of this report and read “Solana the Modular” from August. The main project I wanted to highlight here is Bullet. The tl;dr is that Bullet is a perps appchain on Solana built using the Sovereign Labs SDK. They have a bridge to Solana and use it for DA, posting both ZK and fraud proofs to Solana. They have achieved sub 50ms latency with a target of 5ms – something you can only do with a centralized sequencer. As noted in the intro, perps dex’s are the main proven use case for appchains and so it makes sense Zeta is going with this architecture. They will be the first to try this on Solana and will be able to seamlessly tap into Solana’s native liquidity. After the success of Hyperliquid, it will be one to watch to see how they compete as Hyperliquid moves towards a general purpose L1; Bullet is VM-less, it’s just Rust. Growing Developer Interest Per a16z’s “State of Crypto 2024” report, Solana saw the largest jump in developer interest from 2023 to 2024 and sits at #2 in a sea of EVM chains. As we’ve said before, while Ethereum is in the lead, all of Solana’s metrics continue to go up and to the right. It’s also important to remember Ethereum launched 6 years (2014 vs 2020) before Solana. DoubleZero Announced on December 4th, DoubleZero is essentially trying to create a new internet for high performance blockchains (L1s and L2s). While not part of Solana itself, DZ is dubbed as “the new internet for modern distributed systems” and is built by ex-Solana Foundation employees with contributors from Firedancer and Malbec Labs. Basically, the current internet wasn’t fast enough for blockchains and so they’re trying to build a new internet. IBRL. ETFs While not related to network infrastructure, ETFs are a sign of institutional adoption and are a significant source of flows. There are 4 ETFs now on the table for Solana with the final decision date in August 2025. It is very possible with the new administration we will see a Solana ETF. Job’s Not Finished While Solana has had great momentum over the last year, and there are reasons to expect them to continue delivering, the competition is growing fast and Solana’s continued success is by no means guaranteed. The next three sections are dedicated to these competitors. As mentioned above these are a mix of L1s and L2s, and while single sequencer chains don’t compete towards being the dominant global shared state machine, they do compete for users and liquidity of various applications. High Throughput EVM Chains Hyperliquid, Monad, MegaETH, Unichain, Ithaca, Rise, Sonic, Nil, Berachain Hyperliquid (L1) Out of the chains listed here Hyperliquid is the only one live, so it makes sense to talk about them first. Hyperliquid in its current state is not a general purpose chain, it is a perps appchain that has seen remarkable success in a competitive sector and now accounts for >50% of all perp volume. The perp landscape has seen numerous protocols take top spot like Synthetix, Perp Protocol, GMX and dYdX over the years with none have been able to maintain the lead. The competition is fierce, but that’s because the opportunity (Decentralized Binance) is so big. Why are they in this section then if they’re an appchain? Because they are moving to create a general purpose high throughout EVM L1. However, we should categorize it correctly today. It is not a decentralized perps exchange, it is a centralized, permissioned chain run by the team’s 4 co-located validators in Tokyo. They are aiming to transition to a decentralized, open source L1, but that is not what they are today. With that being said, they have done something rare in launching a new protocol without any funding and enriching a community of diehard supporters. They are kind of building backwards but now have a massive valuation to fund their vision. Hyperliquid is a good example of an appchain being successful and wanting more; wanting to become their own gp chain. The challenge for Hyperliquid now will be how they transition to a decentralized L1 with a globally distributed validator set, all while maintaining the same UX that got them so many diehard users. If you talk to any power user of Hyperliquid they will tell you that it is the best trading experience in the market. Maintaining this experience will be harder as they decentralize and by extension network latency increases. They now have a testnet with more validators outside of the team run ones. Hyperliquid created their own consensus mechanism HyperBFT after pivoting from Tendermint in earlier days. Internal testing with co-located validators shows an end-to-end latency median of 0.2 seconds and 99th percentile at 0.9 seconds. How this performs with a larger, globally distributed validator set is TBD. Their EVM solution is unique and will be different than others on this list. Hyperliquid’s perps and spot order books are all built in Rust and will continue to be isolated to their own environment. The EVM is being added as a generalized VM on top. The native VM is permissioned and tailored to their app, the EVM is permissionless and open to all. The challenge in having two distinct VMs is fragmenting liquidity between the two and getting them to work together seamlessly; the benefit is that EVM congestion shouldn’t impact perps performance. There’s no question Hyperliquid has been a resounding success to date, and their go to market with a 30% community airdrop gives them a strong & dedicated user/holder base moving forward. L1s are never community owned, especially in the post-ICO era. There are significant technical hurdles to pass, but they now have a massive valuation and there are a lot of catalysts/narratives like leading perp dex, leading high throughput EVM chain, and best L1 distribution to help them get there. There is the other question as to if Hyperliquid should even try to decentralize meaningfully. Their product is good because it’s centralized, and users don’t seem to care, not only with Hyperliquid but also L2s governed by multisigs. It’s not clear if the drawback of decentralization is actually worth the degradation in performance, especially as we transition to Trump’s America. A lot of people will point to Hyperliquid’s airdrop as a successful way to launch a new protocol, but the reality is that they built something users just really wanted to use. You can’t airdrop your way to success. Make sure to read the 2025 Markets Year Ahead for their take on the product. Monad (L1) While Monad frequently gets comped to Berachain, MegaETH, and now Hyperliquid, outside of them all being EVM they are quite different. Monad is building the most performant EVM chain they can with consumer hardware. What does this mean? When you decide to build a blockchain, first you must pick the hardware you will use to run the chain. On one end you have Ethereum with very low requirements, on the other Solana with significant requirements. Monad is building for a more reasonable middle ground, being able to validate the chain on something like a MacBook Pro. They are then parallelizing the EVM. Monad is a possible long-term Ethereum L1 construction. In last year’s year ahead report we wrote about Monad’s 4 optimizations: MonadBFT: A derivative of Hotstuff, MonadBFT is a high performance consensus mechanism with 1 second slot times and single slot finality. Deferred Execution: In Monad, execution is decoupled from consensus. This allows for significant throughput increases as consensus can come to the order of transactions before executing. Parallel Execution: Uses optimistic execution. In contrast to Solana, where writes are required to be specified up-front, optimistic execution essentially executes all transactions “optimistically” and then re-tries the ones that conflict (later transaction is re-executed). MonadDb: A custom database for storing blockchain state. The majority of the secret sauce lies in MonadDB. Given that Monad executes transactions in parallel, it would require a database structure that supports multiple read and write operations at once. Ethereum’s LevelDB and RockDB do not natively support asynchronous I/O. If Ethereum would optimistically execute transactions in parallel, its synchronous database operations would be a bottleneck. Monad uses MonadDB, which is purpose-built for parallelized execution. It implements the Patricia Trie data structure both on disk and in memory. This allows data to be updated and verified more efficiently than Ethereum’s MPT. Linux’s latest kernel support enables MonadDB to perform async I/O. Why does the latest kernel matter here? For example, whenever RockDB has to perform read and write operations, it opens up kernels to manage memory, threads, and synchronization. Executing transactions in parallel would open up even more kernels, which would lead to contention for CPU resources, increasing overhead. Linux’s io_uring helps bypass this bottleneck and allows for multiple read and write operations to occur simultaneously. Monad has teams building in numerous sectors and has run a few “Monad Madness” hackathons. A full list of teams interested in building on Monad can be found following Monad Eco on X. Like Hyperliquid, they have done well to build a community before their chain launched. However, there is growing competition between the two camps, even if they aren’t really that similar; Monad raised >$200M, Hyperliquid was bootstrapped without funding. Blockchains are not just about technology, they are about communities and tribes and there are people firmly in either camp (i.e., who made them rich?). Monad testnet should be launching shortly with mainnet next year. Monad has created extremely high expectations over the past year and is now facing some social pressure (from other EVM chains nonetheless) with the success of the less hyped HyperLiquid debut; I think this tweet by Keone sums up well how Monad is different. Regardless of whether HyperLiquid existed or not, Monad has a lot to prove in 2025. There is a big opportunity for a decentralized, performant EVM chain. Unichain (L2) Launched by Uniswap Labs, Unichain should not be confused with the Uniswap AMM product. Unichain is not like Osmosis in being a chain built around AMM infra, it’s a general purpose (or “purpose built”) chain made by Uniswap labs. Unichain aims to solve one of the main reasons why apps are enticed to launch their own appchain: capture their MEV. Unichain has the following properties: Single sequencer but decentralized validator network 1s block times with a longer-term 250ms target Native interop with Superchain Rollup-Boost: Near instant tx’s & MEV/sequencing guarantees for apps The one I want to hone in on is Rollup Boost. If you recall that tweet from Jon Charb above (app launches → takes up blockspace → becomes own appchain, repeat), Unichain aims to solve exactly this; the need for apps to become appchains to capture their own MEV. By utilizing TEEs & Flashbots, Unichain aims to give apps the ability to sequence their own transactions and retain their MEV. Instead of leaking MEV to validators/sequencers, it turns the economics of launching on a GP chain on its head. Unichain is essentially aiming for the best of both worlds: the shared liquidity and composability of a general purpose chain with the customizability and value accrual properties of an appchain. Unichain is another L2 in a long list of high profile OP stack chains led by Base. MegaETH (L2) The extreme end of rollup design, MegaETH is ruthlessly dedicated to performance. They will be running a centralized sequencer with insane requirements: 100 cores 1-4 TB RAM 10 Gbps network bandwidth They will be using alt-DA in EigenDA which is the most abundant alt-DA in the market due to not having consensus. Another main performance improvement is replacing the EVM’s Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) with their own state tree designed from scratch. In their internal testings, using the most performant execution client Reth (which we’ll discuss with Ithaca), they were only able to get 1k TPS due mostly to merkleization (the MPT). Updating the MPT is ~10x more overhead than executing tx’s, and so the main bottleneck doesn’t lie in execution itself. No other blockchain should be as fast as MegaETH given these parameters; if they are it would be a pretty big fail for MegaETH. There is no consensus process and they are running with the most extreme hardware and network requirements. This extreme end of rollup construction will allow them to be the fastest chain on the market. The bottleneck for them is likely going to come from using EigenDA, as there are still network hops in using an external DA layer and it is possible MegaETH’s DA needs are still above what Eigen will be able to provide. I don’t really consider MegaETH a competitor to networks like Solana, Monad, Sui and Aptos (and I think the team would agree), but more so to other rollups. All of these are already single sequencer chains and MegaETH should be most performant. Single sequencer L2s should always be faster than performant L1s and there are tradeoffs to both designs. With that being said, as mentioned before, every single blockchain still does compete for users and liquidity. Ithaca (L2) A project incubated by Paradigm and led by Georgios Konstantopoulos, Paradigm partner, CTO and developer of Reth. Ithaca is a high performant L2 built using Reth, the OP Stack, and Conduit. Reth is a high performance Ethereum node client with a stated goal of getting to 1 gigagas/s. For a comparison of how this compares to EVM chains today, see below. Note that Base is now at 16.5mg/s as they slowly look to scale up. Ithica has an L2 on testnet called Odyssey. Odyssey currently has a 33 mg/s target and has some features such as: EIP-7702: Allows EOA’s to function like Smart Contract accounts EVM Object Format (EOF): Series of EVM improvements, making contracts cheaper EIP-2537: Useful for BLS signatures and ZK proofs RIP-7212: Allows signing with biometric authentication Rise (L2) Also in the EVM gigagas category we have Rise. Their targets are: 100k TPS 1+ Ggas/s <10ms latency Like Ithaca, they’re built on top of Reth with their own parallel EVM “PEVM”, another contender in the “fast EVM L2” category. Like the other performant EVM chains they use a different merkle tree than Ethereum and have their own database. Different from other L2s, Rise aims to use based sequencing with preconfs instead of a centralized sequencer, allowing for better alignment and value accrual to the L1 and a higher degree of decentralization than something like MegaETH. Rise is a fairly new project and I wouldn’t expect mainnet in the near term. Sonic (L1) Rebranded from Fantom, Sonic is led by arguably the pioneer of DeFi summer, Andre Cronje. Their mainnet had their genesis block on December 2nd with public mainnet soon, and outside of a new ticker, brand, and chart, there are some improvements over Fantom. Consensus: Uses an Async BFT mechanism + DAG. With async BFT, nodes don’t need to agree to blocks in sequential order before they’re final. They can come to consensus individually and share blocks async. DAG’s are seen in blockchains like Sui and Aptos and again allows validators to produce blocks async. Database Storage: Sonic’s database prunes historical data automatically, reducing storage requirements for validators. The db is split into two parts: LiveDB and ArchiveDB. Validators use LiveDB which is only the current state and thus a lot lighter. Sonic Gateway: Bridge that has validators operating nodes on Ethereum. There are a bunch of well-know Ethereum apps ready to deploy on Sonic in addition to newer ones, and it’s possible Sonic takes some EVM activity like Fantom did last cycle. Nil (L2) An Ethereum L2 that goes back to Ethereum’s original design choice before rollups: sharding. Nil splits validators into subcommittees to run individual local consensus’ and execution shards. These executions shards run a zkEVM. Each committee then sends their proofs to the main shard for global consensus. Lastly, it is sent to Ethereum like any other ZK rollup. Nil launched their testnet in October. Berachain (L1) It is arguable if Berachain fits into this high throughput camp, but they are a well known, and well funded EVM L1 launching in 2025. Their differentiator and what they’re known for (besides the memes) is their Proof of Liquidity consensus mechanism. Berachain builds AMMs and liquidity directly into the consensus mechanism of the protocol instead of just relying on the native token. Protocols can create their own reward vaults with the objective of obtaining liquidity and then having validators direct emissions to them, aiming to create a sort of flywheel. This is a way for protocols and validators to create partnerships. The reward token for participating in consensus is a separate, soulbound (non-transferable) token than the native gas token, discussed below. You can read their deep-dive on PoL for more. Berachain’s three tokens are as follows: BERA: Gas token and native staking token BGT: Non-transferable governance token earned through providing liquidity. BGT is used to vote on all governance proposals, is used to direct rewards, and can be burned for BERA (but not vice versa). HONEY: CDP stablecoin. Governance will decide which assets can be used to mint HONEY. As an example of the flow between them all, see below chart from a DeFi protocol coming to Berachain. Like Monad, Berachain has raised a lot of capital (>$100M) and is one of the most hyped projects with a large community coming in 2025. Their ecosystem can be viewed here. Berachain will probably be home to some of the wildest ”flywheel” type apps, especially if they launch during the bull market. It did take inspiration from OHM, after all. High Throughput SVM Chains Eclipse, Atlas, Soon, Fogo Eclipse (L2) The first to bring SVM to a rollup, Eclipse is an L2 that uses ETH for gas & proofs and Celestia for DA. After a couple years of development, their mainnet went live on November 7th. Current apps on Eclipse are all Solana ports of Orca, Save, Invariant and Lifinity. Uptake has been slow a month in with ~$5m TVL. The challenge for Eclipse (and all SVM rollups) is getting developers. If you’re building an SVM app you can always deploy on Solana L1 and get access to Solana’s deep and growing liquidity. You don’t face the same fee restrictions that you do on Ethereum L1, so the natural extension of SVM rollups is not as clear. If you look at a bunch of the Solana rollups/extensions they are appchains and stuff like Magic Block’s ephemeral rollups which are very different than gp rollups. Atlas (L2) Created by the team that built Phoenix, the CLOB on Solana, Atlas is an SVM L2 on top of Ethereum (not clear what they will use for DA). They are not exactly a general purpose chain but more so in the “purpose built” category like Unichain. Applications they are targeting are orderbooks (which I assume will be built by them considering Phoenix is a port), margin systems and HFT. Solana developers can port applications easily, and the main differences from Solana are: 50ms vs 400ms block times Timestamps in milliseconds instead of seconds No confirmation levels due to no consensus (tx’s are finalized or not) A lot can still change because Atlas is new, but it’s another “SVM on Ethereum” rollup. Soon (L2) Developed by ex-Optimism engineers, Soon is essentially OP stack but for SVM. Their mainnet will be deployed on top of Ethereum but can be used on top of any L1. Soon is built on the OP Stack with a decoupled SVM (i.e. only the execution and removing consensus mechanism like voting). The Soon team believes SVM is the endgame over EVM and is bringing it to Ethereum and beyond. They have similar challenges to Eclipse highlighted above. Fogo (L1) Full disclosure I have no idea what this is but apparently they will be running an SVM fork with only the Firedancer client. Worth monitoring. High Throughput MVM Chains Sui & Aptos Sui (L1) In my opinion, Sui is the most viable threat to Solana out of all the chains in this report for a few reasons. Like Solana, they are an L1 with globally distributed validators and consensus The decision for an SVM app dev to launch on an SVM rollup vs Solana is not as clear as an EVM dev launching on an EVM rollup, thus I don’t see an SVM rollup competing with Solana MoveVM is performant like SVM and is more developer friendly Sui engineers, like Solana’s, are some of the smartest in the industry and come from Meta’s former blockchain team at Project Diem (eg., Evan their CEO helped build numerous programming languages) The market has (so far) chosen Sui > Aptos as the move chain, with Sui having an FDV 3x Aptos ($47B vs $15.5B) after launching around the same time and valuation Multiple Concurrent Proposers through their DAG (still TBD how this plays out in Sui) Sometimes I think of Sui as the “Academic Solana” (vs Solana’s “we can engineer our way out of any problem” ethos). They have developed a lot of novel things like Narwhal, Mysticeti, native account abstraction, cryptographic extensions, zkSend, SuiLink, internetless transactions, and their new storage protocol Walrus For the deep dive on Sui and explanation of these I will reference the report from Delphi Consulting. The biggest unlock is Sui’s VM using the object centric model. Essentially, assets/tokens on Sui are identified as either shared (AMM pool) or owned (USDC in an account). By leveraging shared vs owned object, Sui can significantly speed up owned object tx’s and is leveraged in their consensus fast path (i.e. p2p transfers like sending USDC from one person to another don’t need to wait for consensus because ordering doesn’t matter). Sui also has a different gas model from other chains. Sui uses a multi-dimensional reference gas price mechanism. It separates fees into two main components: computation fees and storage fees. Computation fees cover the cost of processing transactions and consist of two parts. First is the reference price, determined at the beginning of each epoch (24-hour period) through a Gas Price Survey that determines the reference gas price. The protocol surveys validators and then selects the 2/3 percentile of these prices, weighted by each validator’s stake, as the reference price. This ensures that the reference price is acceptable to most validators. The reference gas price sets a floor on the price the network will accept, but users can specify higher prices for priority access to congested state. Sui Objects live onchain and directly relate to accounts, tokens, NFTs, and smart contracts (packages). This is the second component of fees that users pay. Storage fees are calculated as Storage Fee = Storage Units × Storage Price. Storage Units represent the amount of storage a transaction requires, while the Storage Price is the cost (in SUI) of storing one data unit. Looking at some data, Sui has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of flows from other chains this year, sitting at #3 over the past 3 months and #5 YTD (Note that a large part of Ethereum’s outflows are to L2s). Now, Sui was heavily incentivized with high yields for most of the year, so this is somewhat attributed to that. Still, they now sit at #8 in TVL overall, just behind Arbitrum and ahead of Avalanche with a growing ecosystem. They still don’t have a killer app, but there’s a lot of liquidity and all it really takes is one. Sui has more of an Asia focus, and while it has been leaning into gaming, it now boasts 6 DeFi protocols with >$100M TVL. They got native USDC support with Circle’s CCTP protocol a few months ago and Phantom & Backpack wallet recently expanded there as well. Again, for the full deep dive I will reference the report from Delphi Consulting. Aptos (L1) The other move chain, Aptos shouldn’t be counted out just because it is behind Sui. Aptos’ TVL sits at #11 at $1.3B behind Sui’s $1.7B and they too have a growing DeFi ecosystem. Aptos and Sui’s MoveVM’s are actually different from one another. Aptos started from the original Diem Move whereas Sui built a new one (including their object model). Developers cannot port apps between the two and there are different nuances. Aptos’ Move can be and is used by new modular ecosystems Initia and Movement whereas Sui’s can only be used on Sui. The tradeoff here is that Sui developers are locked into Sui whereas Aptos developers can launch on other chains. It is TBD which long term strategy will win as there are pros/cons to each. It’s still early in the history of these Move chains, and even if one wins vs the other, it doesn’t mean there’s not a world where both are successful and adopted. They’ve both seen increasing development and adoption this year. Slow is Not an Option The high throughput era is just getting started. There are a lot of chains mentioned above and most will not survive. They are not just competing against Solana or with each other — they’re also up against current L2 rollups and new stacks entering the space. We are becoming overloaded with blockspace, and as we’ve seen with token prices over the past year, consolidation is the name of the game. L2 Wars v2 – Base & Arbitrum Drive Consolidation Ethereum Rollup Landscape A year ago I wrote “The L2 Wars”. In it I talked about what would be a year of numerous new L2s with fragmented liquidity, and the era of peace that would transition more into an era of war. This piece held up well, and these challenges are now properly recognized (plus the “war” vibes). As we’ve progressed further into the L2 wars, one thing is clear: they will consolidate. The majority of activity now takes place on either Base or Arbitrum, and this consolidation accelerated post EIP-4844. Looking at DeFi TVL (not to be confused with L2Beat’s “TVL” metric which is just assets minted on chain), Base and Arbitrum make up nearly 2/3 of all L2 TVL. There are notable declines like Blast, zkSync Era and Optimism over the same period. The same goes for DEX volumes. While TVL is 2/3 Base and Arbitrum, nearly all of L2 DEX volume is now happening on the two chains. And lastly, User Operations per Second. Outside of Base and Arbitrum, only Taiko has more UOPS than Ethereum. Read that again. The low throughput, tx limited Ethereum L1 is doing more UOPS than the majority of L2s. What does this all mean? Consolidation. All of these rollups are general purpose EVMs. Sure, some are optimistic, some are zk, and some are based; but they are all essentially the same product. There will be power laws here and we are seeing Base and Arbitrum start to reap those rewards. As I alluded to above, these divergences accelerated post EIP-4844. As a refresher, 4844 was the introduction of blob markets which made Ethereum DA significantly cheaper. But the benefits were not evenly distributed; now that every L2 can handle more tx’s, the winners took more. We can look at Base & Arbitrum vs Blast & zkSync Era. That green diamond in March ‘24 is when 4844 went live. Activity Spikes From EIP-4844 Arbitrum Base Activity Drops From EIP-4844 Blast zkSync Era As Base keeps raising their gas limit and Arbitrum continues to scale themselves, it seems likely that these chains will continue to move higher in adoption. Users need a reason to use another L2 and if the one they’re using is handling their needs then they don’t need to move; save it for an anticipated airdrop. Does the Pudgy Penguin airdrop signal anything here? Pudgy Penguins Choosing Solana Over any L2 Pudgy Penguins, one of the most popular (and arguably most mainstream) Ethereum NFTs chose Solana as their chain of choice for their token over any Ethereum L2. This is an auspicious decision, and some have highlighted it is a “vampire” attack to eventually move users from Solana to their EVM L2 Abstract when it launches. You may think it’s a “stupid memecoin” and has no implications, but to me this highlights a failure of L2s to develop a product users want to use. As highlighted earlier, Solana has become the chain to launch tokens and trade assets. The fact that Pudgy chose Solana over any L2, especially as it’s an Ethereum project, speaks volumes to this and the lost opportunity for L2s. I see it less a failure of Ethereum and more a failure of the L2s to develop a product users want. And it’s not just NFTs, as we highlighted earlier it’s also young talent leaving to the Solana ecosystem as well. Leading Stacks: Optimism vs Arbitrum It is no question that Optimism and Arbitrum are the leading stacks today, however they have taken very different approaches to one another. Optimism is leading the BD/OP Stack adoption charge, getting numerous rollups like Base, Blast, World Chain, Mode, Zircuit, Zora and upcoming Ink by Kraken, Unichain by Uni Labs, and even SVM stack Soon. On the other side, Arbitrum’s stack doesn’t have nearly as much adoption but does target certain niches like Apechain, Sanko, Real RWA, gaming and a few others. Another notable difference is that Arbitrum main chain is the largest Arbitrum rollup (and largest in general) whereas Optimism main chain has seen activity continue to decline with Base and I would expect this trend to continue with some of the upcoming ones. A good way to visualize this is Velodrome ($137M mcap) vs Aerodrome ($1.5B mcap). Aerodrome is a fork of Velodrome by the same team that launched on Base; its valuation is >10x higher. Looking at the top 10 rollups & validiums for each stack, it is clear that Arbitrum is the largest by total assets issued, while OP Stack has higher total adoption (note that $1.6B of Arbitrum’s number is bridged to Hyperliquid). Moving forward we will see which strategy is more effective: adoption of the OP stack at the cost of cannibalizing Optimism main chain vs Arbitrum main chain being the leader in their ecosystem. Other Stacks: Starknet, Polygon, zkSync, Scroll The other stacks are all of the zk ones, and maybe they need more time for the tech to improve to get adoption. Starknet took a different path than other rollups, focusing on developing an entirely new ecosystem built around their language Cairo. The early days of Starknet, to put it lightly, were rough. Using the chain was like using a dial up modem and swaps would take minutes to confirm on average. However, that is no longer the case, and by forgoing EVM for Cairo they’ve been able to implement many major UX improvements. Every account is a contract account by default, which means you can do things like approve, swap, deposit, stake all in one tx. The Argent wallet works well and has nice web2 features like email 2FA. Lastly, Starknet is not just an Ethereum play as they have been deep in OP_CAT discussions and are expected to compete in the Bitcoin rollup eco as well. They took the long game by not going EVM which has taken them longer to develop an ecosystem (due to devs needing to learn a new language) but I believe this will eventually pay off and 2025 is the year we start to see these signs. For a dive into their DeFi eco be sure to read the DeFi year ahead next week. Polygon is interesting here because of their work on AggLayer whose launch is coming soon. The main issue that needs to be solved when it comes to rollups is fragmentation of liquidity. AggLayer, while developed by Polygon, is something every rollup can opt into for bridging and cross-chain interop needs. AggLayer has four components: Pessimistic Proof: ZK proof security mechanism that ensures no chain can withdraw more assets than they have deposited in the bridge (i.e. can’t rug other chain’s liquidity). Proof Aggregation: Aggregating proofs across many chains tapped in lowers costs for everyone. Has a cold start problem as it gets cheaper (i.e. further amortized) as more chains join. Unified Bridge: All chains share the assets in the same contract on Ethereum. Makes for better cross-chain interop. Fast Interop: A future feature, will allow cross-chain settlement to be faster than Ethereum. zkSync has their own similar solution for this with their Elastic Chain. As we mentioned last year, all of the rollup solutions have their own interop standards and bridges (Arbitrum bridge & orbit chains, Superchain, AggLayer, Elastic Chain). Competition is good because it will lead to the best tech getting developed, but it is still unclear if all Ethereum rollups will decide on a unified standard (seems unlikely, at least in the medium term, especially if new “SuperchainERC20” standards are being pushed). Stage 2 or Bust Lastly, it’s time to see the training wheels come off. 2025 will show who has the tech to fulfill the promise of rollups. New Stacks & L2s Initia, Movement, Taiko, Spire, Fuel, Soon, Fluent, Rogue, Sigil, Last Network, Bitcoin Rollups Not only do existing L2s have a lot of competition from the new high throughput chains, or the current crop of L2 chains, but there is a whole host of new stacks entering the ring as well. Competition is only getting fiercer. The main stacks & L2s to follow are below. Initia What Cosmos was meant to be. If there is a stack that will fulfill the appchain vision I believe it will be Initia or some of the newer, further out ones like Delta, Pod & InfinityVM (we’ll discuss in detail later). Initia is building an ecosystem dedicated to appchains from scratch. Initia’s L1 serves as a coordination layer to all of the appchains (minitias) built on top. While Initia’s L1 uses the Aptos MoveVM, minitias can be a variety of alt-VMs like Move, EVM and WasmVM. The L1 also incorporates a liquidity hub with “enshrined liquidity”. Think Balancer for the L1, this architecture diversifies the staking assets for the L1, is used for mintita to minitia routing, and gas fees. Initia will have numerous integrations out of the box like support for Noble USDC through IBC, LayerZero integration for a coordinated standard for minitias, a kickback mechanism to minitias, oracles, programmable mempoools through Skip, and more. They want to go live ready to fully support an ecosystem of appchains. Some Minitia’s in development are: Civitia: onchain finance board game Echelon: money market Contro: markets built around their new primitive Gradual Limit Order Books (GLOB) Blackwing: liquidation free margin trading Inertia: LRT & lending protocol Infinity Ground: AI content creation platform Zaar: NFT Marketplace Milkway: liquid staking Movement Another rollup eco based off the MoveVM, Movement launched their token on Dec 9th and opened at an $8B FDV; the chain, however, is not yet live. Movement will have both a MoveVM and EVM as they aim to keep compatible with the large, existing EVM ecosystem while also supporting “next-gen” VMs like Move. Their main chain is a general purpose L2 on top of Ethereum that uses Celestia for DA. Different from some other rollups that have a bridge to Ethereum, Movement will use their own MOVE token as the native gas paying token on their L2. Like other rollup stacks, they aim to support numerous constructions like ZK/ORU, shared sequencing, Ethereum & Alt-DA, and more. Based Rollups: Taiko & Spire We first wrote about Based Rollups in March and since then we have seen more teams developing them. These are not to be confused with native rollups which we’ll talk about later. Taiko is live today with $390M in TVL led by lending apps Avalon Labs and TakoTako. Due to the nature of being based (and using L1 for sequencing) their costs add up quite a bit, and are by far the top rent paying rollup on Ethereum. While not ideal for users on Taiko, it is aligned with the L1. Finding this balance for based and native rollups will be important and these costs should fall significantly with preconfs. Spire isn’t yet live but is the other based rollup stack, recently having raised $7M from some notable investors. One interesting decision is Spire’s integration of Rome protocol, a protocol that uses Solana for based sequencing. We’ve spoken before about how the ideal L1 for based rollups is a fast with with short block times, and Solana is that. Based rollups are provably better for the economics of Ethereum L1, but they have challenges with respect to UX and user adoption. They are an area to watch (along with native rollups) as they may become the endgame for rollups. Fuel One of the most anticipated rollups from a few years ago (check the date of our deep dive), Fuel has had some internal issues that have delayed their launch. Their mainnet went live on October 16th. Soon Mentioned in high throughput section above but worth highlighting here again. OP Stack for SVM. Fluent The “blended execution network”, Fluent supports all of EVM, SVM and Wasm all in one VM, allowing developers from every eco to build together. It is planning on extending support to CairoVM and MoveVM as well. Rogue A project out of LambdaClass (used to work with Starknet), Rogue is a no VC, no team allocation, fair launch ZK L2. Rogue will use based sequencing, proving and TEEs. The Lambda team are some of the smartest in the industry and the addition of the fair launch mechanics make this one to watch. A full description is in the tweet below. Sigil We talked about how rollups need to move to at least stage 1 in 2025 and the training wheels need to come off. Sigil is a rollup that is going to launch as a fully decentralized, Stage 2 rollup from day one (timeline TBD). Last Network Pitched as a “cashflow generating chain that reinvests back into the community”, Last Network is a DeFi focused EVM rollup built around its stablecoin USDxl. This is a CDP stablecoin minted by crypto assets which directs chain profits into US Treasuries to distribute as USDxl profits to both USDxl holders and DeFi users. Bitcoin Rollups Lastly, we must mention that an eco of rollups are coming to Bitcoin powered by BitVM and OP_CAT. We’ve spoken about Starknet and their intentions to bridge to Bitcoin (tbd if current rollup or a new one) but there are also many others like Citrea, Bitlayer, Yona, BOB and more. The Bitcoin rollup deep dive can be found here and we’ll cover again later in the zk section of this report. What About Ethereum L1 So far we have talked about Solana and other high throughput chains, the current rollup landscape, and the upcoming rollup landscape. But we have not yet talked about Ethereum. From the Beam chain, to single slot finality, to Native rollups, there are a lot of developments to track in 2025 with Ethereum. Ethereum – The Near to Long Term Future Previously, The Merge and the Beacon Chain upgrade served as Ethereum’s North Star, rallying the community around a shared technical goal. Since then, it seems the Ethereum community lacks a clear, unified direction for prioritizing technical upgrades. Ethereum has always focused on building a permissionless, transparent, and globally decentralized system—prioritizing decentralization over all other metrics, as Vitalik encapsulated with DOPE. This emphasis comes with trade-offs, such as sacrificing L1 performance. Most Devcon talks highlighted the importance of maintaining decentralization over and above performance and scalability. Flashbots’ co-founder, emphasized four pillars for ‘Ethereum 3.0’: permissionlessness, distribution, geo-economic decentralization, and neutral-builder efficiency. The lack of consensus on Ethereum’s priorities and roadmap has led some to describe this lack of coordination as Ethereum’s “Cosmosification.” While Cosmos pioneered appchains, shared security, and async cross-chain messaging—trends now shaping the crypto ecosystem—it failed to gain traction. A key issue was the lack of coordination between appchains and the Cosmos Hub, leaving its purpose unclear. Similarly, Ethereum faces fragmentation: no unified vision for its L1, L2s competing with each other, and L1 apps launching their own general-purpose L1s. Ethereum lacks a unified “North Star” (or has multiple), as there’s no consensus among stakeholders—researchers, app developers, ACD, clients, etc. While not ideal, this is the nature of a truly decentralized and distributed system. But this tradeoff comes at the expense of losing market share, with competitors outperforming Ethereum in key metrics. Ethereum’s situation is a byproduct of being an early pioneer. As other ecosystems mature and achieve mass adoption, they too will face similar issues, with diverse teams contributing to clients and upgrades taking different directions. For example, Solana contributors are increasing through client teams (firedancer, Jito, agave), Helius, zk teams, and even Anza splitting from Solana Labs. Even though within the EF we find fragmentation and confrontations of roadmaps, Vitalik thinks that developers within the EF building different products “don’t interfere with each other”. In reality, I don’t know if this is true: some proposals are fundamentally opposed to each other. For instance, ePBS, which aims to remove dependency on relays, stands in contrast to preconfs, which would reintroduce relays or “gateways” for fast preconfirmations. So why enshrine ePBS when relays are going to stay anyway? Scaling the L1 Increasing The Gas Limit For context, the block gas limit is the amount of computation (which loosely means amount of transactions) that can be included in an Ethereum block, which is currently set at 30M gas. Ethereum validators can change the block gas limit if >50% of them are in favor of the increase. As of December 2024, 2.5% of them are signalling to increase it, which would be the first time since The Merge (!!) that Ethereum increased the gas limit. Back when Ethereum operated through PoW, miners increased the gas limit 6 different times. Raising the gas block limit by 100% gives Ethereum L1 the ability to process 100% more transaction load in a day, help reduce network congestion, and lower txs fees (unless induced demand offsets it). Increasing the gas limit has been a hot topic in Ethereum since, well, forever. Ethereum L1 hasn’t increased block gas limits since 4 years ago. There were no agreements around this, basically there are 2 sides: Some argue that increasing it will lead to solo stakers not being able to continue validating, some are even in favor of further reduce gas limit, Some argue in favor of the increase, pointing to the natural improvements in hardware and client optimization over the past four years, which have made it more feasible for node operators to handle higher resource demands. In January, Vitalik proposed a modest 33% increase. Nethermind developer Tomasz also stated in favor. Justin Drake raised his validator gas limit at 36M recently. One downside argument is that increasing the gas limit also increases the resources required to run and maintain Ethereum nodes. A 100% increase in the gas limit could place a heavy burden on node operators, potentially causing some to drop off the network, negatively impacting the decentralization of the network, as fewer operators may be able to participate. However, during Devcon, Marek Moraczyński presented data-driven research on why an increase is justified and safe for Ethereum. Also, three recent independent studies on node performance have been presented, suggesting nodes on Ethereum can handle larger blocks without major trade offs. ‘Decentralization and solo staking must be means to a clearer end, not the end goal themselves’ It recently became a hot topic on CT again, with a push in favor of doubling it from 30M to 60M, and it seems this time the general sentiment is gaining some social consensus over raising it. A community-driven initiative led by Mariano Conti and Eric Conner launched a website to educate stakers on how they can signal their support for a gas limit increase called Pumpthegas. Contrarian views, like Evan Van Ness, argued against any increase at all, saying that gas prices on Ethereum were already relatively low and an increase may negatively impact the health of the network. As one of the largest pools running validators, with a ~28% market share, Lido community is also actively participating in the discussion, with voices in favor to increase it to at least 40M from Consensys, Everstake, and others. SSF and Shorter Block Times Scaling the L1 doesn’t necessarily mean we need to aim for perfection in all aspects; improving L1 performance also makes it more suitable for rollups. L2s need an L1 with fast slots and SSF to achieve usable finality, interoperability, and, if they’re based, sequencing. With SSF and shorter block times, we could establish a more effective coordination layer to support cross-rollup composability and synchronization. Multiple protocols realized this and have already implemented these features to become an effective coordination layer (e.g. Celestia, AggLayer, Espresso). As a result, we may see increased competition among networks aiming to become the primary coordination layer for rollups to interoperate seamlessly, developing their own L2 interoperability standards (e.g. Superchain ERC20) Currently, rollup interoperability is limited due to the lack of an efficient coordination layer. For rollups, waiting for two Ethereum L1 epochs (~13 minutes) to finalize blocks is impractical. To serve as a suitable coordination layer for facilitating cross-rollup commitments, a fast consensus mechanism and shorter block times are a must. Decentralization and Censorship Resistance Ethereum must safeguard its core values of global decentralization and censorship resistance, which will be improved by involving multiple parties in block construction and introducing a new consensus transaction policy (e.g., FOCIL and BuilderNet). FOCIL works by having 16 validators in each slot who include the transactions they’ve seen into an aggregated master list, which serves as the starting point for builders to construct the block. Builders can modify the list in two ways: by reordering transactions or by inserting transactions to front-run or back-run, but they cannot exclude these txs from the block. FOCIL still ensures a healthy and decentralized block-building process from an inclusion standpoint, with only the final piece, handled by the builders, being centralized. However, as of today, block building on Ethereum is dominated by just two builders currently building ~90% of Ethereum blocks, and three relays. Vitalik anticipated this scenario in the Endgame blog Native Rollups Martin Koeppelmann, Co-founder of Gnosis, introduced the idea of “Native Rollups” (NR) during Devcon. Native rollups are rollups built with Ethereum values such as decentralization and credible neutrality from scratch, translating into rollups fully controlled by the Ethereum protocol itself and not by multi-sigs. They will have multiple-client proof systems implementation, and rigorous testing of the rollup codebase, just like Ethereum. It seems to just be an “enshrined rollup” rebranding. Native rollups are “rollups validated on the opcode level, instead of solidity level”. They differ from based rollups in that based rollup re-utilize the sequencing layer of the base layer, but execution still happens off-chain and then a proof of correctness is submitted to settle on Ethereum. But these proofs can be submitted arbitrarily by centralized operators whatever they want, whereas with NR proofs are built and verify in-protocol by Ethereum validators. However, although in native rollups the execution also happens off-chain, the introduction of a zk proof (or various types of zk proofs) natively integrated into the opcode allows native rollups to be fully compatible with the EVM, meaning that the base layer directly supports and coordinates rollup operations. Martin suggests we should create 128 highly interoperable instances of native rollups, which would act as a parallel execution environment while remaining interoperable with others and the Ethereum L1. This sounds a lot like the sharding implementation that Ethereum was seeking in the past. Main differences that I see are that, NR are interoperable with each other as they share the base layer, but won’t maintain perfect composability. Sharding would need Inter-shard communication, effectively losing composability between shards. NR Inherits Ethereum L1 security through ZK proofs, while shards inherits Ethereum L1 security directly. The Beam Chain During Devcon, a new proposal self-named by the ETH community ‘Ethereum 3.0’, surfaced on CT. While not quite what Doug forecasted, it’s a proposal to introduce the Beam Chain, a bundled consensus layer upgrade, as a replacement for the Beacon Chain, and seeks to accelerate Ethereum’s roadmap by leveraging zk technology. It integrates ZK proofs directly into block validation. Justin Drake’s motivation for introducing the Beam Chain proposal is “to introduce a new meme” that unites the Ethereum community and gives developers a common goal. He aims to streamline governance by categorizing upgrades into high-priority tasks and ambitious changes, bundling the latter into a single release to reduce governance complexity and drive collaboration. The estimated timeline? Five years. Although the Beam Chain proposal is quite cool, it doesn’t quite feel like a ‘North Star’ that everyone is ready to rally behind, especially when considering the general reaction from CT to the 5y roadmap. Let’s break it down The Merge transitioned Ethereum from PoW to PoS, replacing miners with validators staking 32 ETH each. This reduced energy consumption by ~99.9% and eliminated computational competition. The Beacon Chain Consensus Layer (CL) merged with Ethereum’s execution layer (EL), preserving compatibility with existing smart contracts and dApps. This change set the stage for future improvements like sharding and lower gas costs via DA improvements. We have all seen the complex and never-ending Vitalik image drawing Ethereum’s roadmap, but to be honest I never fully understood it. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the key phases: The Surge (In Progress) – The goal is to significantly scale Ethereum. Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844) introduced blobs, a precursor to full danksharding. These blobs store large amounts of data off-chain, and are targeted for reducing L2 costs by replacing their use of calldata as DA. Once fully implemented, Ethereum will split up into 64 shards processing DA and txs in parallel. The Verge (In Progress) – focuses on simplifying and optimizing data verification using Verkle Trees, which are advanced data structures that allow nodes to store less information while verifying the entire chain. This will drastically reduce storage requirements and make it easier to run lightweight nodes by just having to verify a SNARK to validate a full block. The Purge (Pending) – Ethereum will get rid of unnecessary data, reducing chain complexity. Historical data will be removed; nodes will only need to store recent, relevant network data, reducing storage requirements. State optimization will improve sync times and ease the burden on new nodes. This will reduce operational costs, and increase node participation. The Splurge (Pending) – The ‘everything else’ phase, including additional upgrades to improve Ethereum and resolve unforeseen issues. By integrating ZK proofs (SNARKs / STARKs) in-protocol, full blocks could be verified without requiring all nodes to process every transaction. Community sentiment around the five year horizon was badly received, as many believed these five years would be a ‘dark path’ until full implementation. However, I don’t think this is going to be the case, as there will be numerous intermediate updates and incremental improvements across all three sublayers in the middle to be implemented in the Beacon Chain; the five year roadmap is going to be decoupled. I think what Justin was trying to achieve by bundling all upgrades into a single proposal is to create a shelling point for the Ethereum community. For example, some upgrades across the three sublayers will be:**** EL (enshrined zkVMs, native rollups, delay the stateRoot to reduce L1 latency and increase throughput, increase gas limit by ~10x-100x) DA (increase max blobs per block, PeerDAS, full Danksharding), and CL (inclusion lists to improve censorship, MaxEB to consolidate ETH validator balances, reduce ETH staking requirements to 1 ETH, encrypted mempools to prevent toxic MEV, faster slots) ZK vendors (specialized nodes) will generate zk proofs validating sets of txs or even entire blocks. Nodes will need to verify only these proofs instead of processing all txs, reducing their computational burden. However, I’m skeptical about this in the long-term as my concern lies in the centralization of these ZK vendors. If a small group of zk providers dominates the field, Ethereum could face a centralization risk similar to today’s builder landscape, where only two entities construct over 90% of blocks. In the Consensus Sublayer, some improvements include: Up to 90% of transactions could be preconfirmed by rollups By reducing the staking requirement to just 1 ETH, validators could consolidate their stake Chain Snarkification to reduce hardware dependency + combined with the 1 ETH staking would enable thousands of new validators to join the network in a much lighter way But what does it mean to ‘Snarkify the chain’? From consensus to EVM, Beam Chain will try to add zk to every module of the Ethereum protocol. There will be a zk EVM pre-compile that will simplify launching zk rollups, and developers won’t need to worry about bugs as the pre-compile will be enshrined in-protocol. The proof verification process on Ethereum is costly for practically all of the zk proofs in production today because it requires the execution of expensive on-chain operations to verify the proofs. Currently, the EVM does not have enshrined support (or precompiles) for zk proofs. Precompiles are optimized and pre-built ‘smart contracts’ in the EVM itself that can handle specific tasks more efficiently, e.g. the ecrecover (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Recovery) precompile helps to confirm ‘who’ signed a message being presented to a smart contract. The list of precompiles in the EVM is not capped, i.e. the network had a couple of upgrades to support multiple precompiles as the network needed them as the time went by, e.g. Pectra fork will include a precompìle for BLS12-381 curve operations. The lack of these precompiles for zk proofs means that the verification process is not optimized and computationally expensive to do it directly in Ethereum. Precompiles are designed for specific purposes, such as for a particular proving system like Groth16 or Plonk. Ok, back to the Beam Chain: By snarkifying Ethereum, any entity which consumes the Ethereum chain can do it with extremely low resources, by verifying a single proof, and syncing to the tip of the chain. This would make sure we wouldn’t have any further dependency on Infura, but does this imply we’ll get rid of centralization forces? As stated earlier, with the introduction of ZK-vendors, I don’t think so. Other improvements discussed in the proposal include Reduce slot times from 12s to 4s Preconfirmations as fast as 100ms, which he stated that “will soon give faster-than-Solana transactions” Implement APS (Attester Proposer Separation). Similar to PBS, which decouples the tasks of proposers and builders, with APS the goal is to decouple attestation tasks from proposers to I. remove timing games as a concern to validators, II. remove MEV spikes due to volatility, III. remove worries about sophistication by having to deposit collateral with preconfirmations However, validators are still responsible for the most critical part of block building: which is to include tx on the chain and be censorship resistant, something that could be addressed by FOCIL. While I agree that current narratives aren’t as compelling as they were in 2021, concepts like decentralization have lost traction, and users no longer seem to care about them. It’s clear that what they want is fast confirmations and low fees. In my opinion, builders are disconnected from users, focusing too much on infrastructure without aligning it with real-world user experiences or current needs. Ethereum still boasts the strongest network effects of any blockchain. It remains the most battle-tested blockchain (with no outages) for Web3 developers and the most thoroughly studied by researchers and developers tackling cutting-edge challenges like scaling, MEV, and censorship resistance. Does this guarantee that Ethereum will always lead the pack? That’s hard to say. Could Ethereum learn from its competitors? Absolutely. The Ethereum community needs to stop underestimating and dismissing its rivals and instead pay closer attention to the needs of the users that Solana has successfully attracted. That being said, it’s worth noting that Drake’s Beam Chain is just a proposal, it still needs to gather feedback and community approval, something that’s not really happening as of today, even within EF developers. Pectra Dencun was the last upgrade on Ethereum L1 deployed in March 2024. Pectra (Prague-Electra) is the next hard-fork upgrade expected to be activated as early as Q1 2025. It targets to improve UX for L1 users as well as protocol consensus upgrades. Account Abstraction One of the potential upgrades included is EIP 7702 crafted by Vitalik, which targets EOA accounts to introduce a new tx type for end-users. Once implemented it will add additional capabilities to their accounts such as: batching transactions (so we wouldn’t have to approve txs one by one), authorizing multiple on-chain actions from signing a single transaction, sponsorship, paying for a tx on behalf of another account, and introduces custom-logic on-chain to be able to e.g. customize the conditions of spending on the account balance. Since most users interact with Ethereum through wallets, wallet developers will need to integrate the new tx type and make it easily accessible for users to improve their UX. Staking Max Balance EIP 7251 increases the maximum effective balance of validators from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH and allows existing validators with a maximum effective balance of 32 ETH to consolidate their stake into a single validator instead of multiple ones, thereby reducing the number of validators on the network, which currently are >1 million. Blobs A blob capacity increase in Pectra is likely to be included, as there is general consensus that it is necessary to accommodate rollup demand and prevent fee hikes. However, since EIP 7549 (PeerDAS)—an upgrade aimed at improving data availability (DA) efficiency through DA sampling instead of requiring full block downloads—is unlikely to be included in Pectra, an alternative proposal suggests a simpler adjustment to reduce DA costs. Currently, Ethereum processes up to six blobs per block, dynamically adjusting their costs to maintain an average of three blobs per block. EIP 7742, Uncouple Blob Count Between CL and EL, introduces flexibility by allowing the CL to dynamically adjust the max and target blob limits. This change eliminates the need for hard forks on both the EL and CL to update blob capacity. Instead, future adjustments to DA capacity can be made exclusively through the CL, ensuring that the blob gas fee mechanism scales effectively with updates to target and maximum values. EIP 7762 proposes increasing the MIN_BASE_FEE_PER_BLOB_GAS. When blob demand exceeds the target rate, the protocol automatically raises the base fee for blobs, following a mechanism similar to Ethereum transactions under EIP 1559. This adjustment aims to make blob fees more responsive to demand fluctuations, enabling faster price discovery in the blob fee market. Lately, there has been criticism labeling rollups as parasitic to Ethereum and questioning the value of the rollup-centric roadmap. Introducing a small base fee could effectively address these concerns, and encourage rollups to flow a more substantial portion of their revenue back to Ethereum. It’s intriguing, to say the least, to see the Ethereum community align on increasing the blob count, which effectively increases block size, yet remain divided on raising the overall gas limit due to concerns that it could undermine decentralization by discouraging solo stakers. In the short term, these DA improvements may reduce Ethereum L1 protocol revenue, as rollups posting blobs will pay fewer fees to Ethereum, with the revenue instead going to L2 centralized sequencers. However, L2 users will greatly benefit from this, as it will lower tx fees for them. This has always been a common criticism of the rollup-centric roadmap: rollups posting DA pay minimal fees to Ethereum, raising concerns about the potential impact on ETH’s value. On top of that, when rollup costs posting DA to Ethereum become too high and saturate the blob market, causing blob costs to rise for every rollup, they may switch to an alt-DA to reduce their costs. That’s why Ethereum needs to be prepared to increase the blob count for rollups, to support the potential demand they will face in the future. Still, everyone agrees that the L2 roadmap is the correct approach. The million-dollar question that no one can give a clear answer to is, what should be kept on L1 and what should be outsourced to L2. It’s, as Vitalik himself said, “A big question that any L1 scaling roadmap needs to answer is: what is the ultimate vision for what belongs on L1 and what belongs on L2?”. Some claim that Ethereum should “Maximize what you can do on L1, then overflow to L2”. Some others think that “there is no future for the L1 directly. The L1 is a settlement layer”. It’s an open question that I believe will ultimately be decided by those who truly care about it: the users. So far, the “migration” from L1 to L2s has not been fully completed, as Ethereum L1 is still the preferred launchpad for some major apps (Ethena, Morpho, EigenLayer). It remains the dominant layer with the most network effects, liquidity, and composability between major apps. I believe the rollup-centric roadmap is paving the way for Ethereum to support 100x-1000x more on-chain activity than the Ethereum L1 can handle. However, this needs to be considered in the long term, as protocol revenue will likely decrease in the short term if Ethereum improves DA for rollups. Over-optimizing for rollups might be counterproductive for ETH’ value. Yet, rollups are still highly centralized being operated by single sequencers, and Ethereum L1 core values of “decentralization, permissionless, and censorship-resistance” are no longer properties we have seen rollups prioritizing. Trading off these values for fast confirmations and low-fees was understandable a while ago as they were in early stages. However, as Vitalik said early this year, “I take this seriously. Starting next year, I plan to only publicly mention (in blogs, talks, etc) L2s that are stage 1+, with maybe a short grace period for new genuinely interesting projects. It doesn’t matter if I invested, or if you’re my friend; stage 1 or bust.” As a reminder, Stage 1 rollups are the ones that have a system which satisfies these properties: A complete and functional proof system is deployed, there are at least 5 external actors who can submit fraud proofs, users are able to exit without the help of the permissioned operators, and in case of an unwanted upgrade by actors more centralized than a Security Council, users have at least 7d to exit. As of December 2024, there are just three rollups at Stage 1 (Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync Lite) These EIPs targeting Account Abstraction (AA) in L1 and improving blob capacity seem to cater to different types of users, highlighting that Ethereum is working to improve both L1 and L2 UX. DA improvements are designed to help rollup users, which may shift traffic away from L1, while EIP 7702 (AA) focuses on UX improvements for L1 users. However, it’s important to remember that the upgrade lifecycle typically follows four phases: I. Devnet, II. Testnet, III. Mainnet, and after successful implementation in L1, they are generally adopted by rollups and side chains, so they will be benefiting from these improvements in the end. Fusaka The next upgrade after Pectra will be Fusaka (Fulu-Osaka), which aims to introduce a key single upgrade, Verkle trees, in order to minimize the technical risks associated with bundling multiple upgrades. This transition is expected to be major, as it will change how Ethereum nodes manage network state. Currently, Ethereum uses Merkle Patricia Trees to store network state (account balances, smart contracts, and storage data). The problem is that as Ethereum grows, the data stored in these trees becomes large and harder to manage. Nodes need to store all this data to fully validate the network, requiring more and more resources over time. Verkle Trees are an advanced version of Merkle Trees that use vector commitments, enabling much smaller proofs of data inclusion. Nodes handling state will be relieved allowing them to be stateless, meaning that this will enable lightweight nodes to validate the network without storing all historical state data. These nodes rely on proofs provided by full nodes (stateful clients). With lower resource needs, more users would be able to join the network and run nodes. Although these are not the main focus of the Pectra or Fusaka, Eth community is also actively discussing reducing ETH issuance and improving censorship resistance, which is likely to have a more significant impact on ETH price. An Age of Cryptographic Renaissance Over a hundred years ago, we used cryptography in the context of electronic warfare with specialized machines such as the Enigma, which was purpose-built to decrypt military communications in World War II. It shortened the war by several years and saved millions of lives, enabling the Allies to anticipate and counter German actions effectively. Since then, with internet access raging and reaching further than ever, the rate at which humans innovate has drastically increased in the last few decades. We’ve been converging at generation-defining technologies at shorter intervals, time and again. As with all things in markets, we’re in a race to identify and capitalize on these technologies. In the last decade, crypto companies have raised an estimated $200B across 17K deals. A good chunk of this funding has flown to research and development on cryptographic methods across ZK, FHE, MPC, and TEEs. Cryptography Market Map by Electric Capital From scaling Ethereum with rollups, solving interoperability with bridges, and having distributed multi-sig wallets. We are now at the cusp of entering the age of programmable cryptography with general-purpose systems that don’t just cater to one-off use cases but rather act as a co-processor for n types of uses. Similar to how we initially used specific devices to monitor oxygen levels, heart rate, and ECG to using wearable health monitors like smartwatches that integrate multiple health-tracking sensors (heart rate, blood oxygen levels, ECG, etc.) into a single, portable device. Over the last few years, we’ve had quite a few advancements across ZK, MPC, FHE, and TEEs that I believe are taking us closer to realizing the dream of a global private-shared state. The way programmable cryptography could play out resonates with Vitalik’s idea of glue and coprocessor architecture. We’ve seen this play out with other components. Blockchains optimize for throughput and offload computation requiring specific & external logic to off-chain components, as done with oracles and bridges. The same is going to happen with verifiability/confidentiality/privacy. The “glue” acts as a flexible interface, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to build complex systems without being constrained by the performance limitations of a single component. “Co-processors,” on the other hand, are designed to handle computationally intensive operations that have specialized designs such as generating zero-knowledge proofs, encrypting and decrypting data, or executing MPC or FHE algorithms. Developers can leverage zkVMs and fheVMs, among other coprocessors, without being cryptography experts themselves. The next frontier for cryptography is with general-purpose cryptography, where we move from computing within silos to shared-private states, where we abstract cryptographic complexities to allow developers to get wild with their ideas. ZKfying Everything Under The Sun Out of all the cryptographic methods, research & development on ZK has received the biggest push with both capital and talent. From being used to create validity proofs across several zk-rollups to helping build the future of bridging with ZK light clients. Optimistic rollups such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Taiko, Fuel, and many others have been working on hybrid proving systems by integrating zkVMs such as Risc0 zkVM and SP1 by Succinct. Beyond Ethereum, non-ZK/privacy L1s such as Solana and Sui have invested resources in ZK. One of the ways Solana is trying to manage state growth is with the use of ZK compression. Sui has built out ZK tooling with zkLogin that allows users to create and manage wallets with emails safely without compromising their data. Tangible Impact of ZK Across Infrastructure & Applications Based on data from Our Network and zkstats.io, over ~1.6M proofs have been submitted to Ethereum mainnet since 2021, with total settlement costs (TSF) crossing ~$60M. TSF peaked in Dec-23 with $15M, most of the fees being paid by Linea, ZkSync and Scroll. The numbers might seem underwhelming given the period of operations and the number of projects, but there are a few things to consider. Proof generation and verification costs have been getting more efficient. Most, if not all, of the rollups, use recursive proof aggregation to cut down volume and costs. This is where one ZKP is used to validate a sequence of ZKPs, leading to only a single or few ZKPs being submitted for verification on Ethereum. Most of the proof volume and TSF are seen coming from zk-rollups compared to applications. Applications such as Tornado Cash and Railgun not only operate on Ethereum but also on L2s and networks such as BSC and Polygon. Given that the costs of privacy and transaction fees are magnitudes lower on L2s, a significant volume of their activity does not directly settle on Ethereum. Proof volume from Tornado Cash started to decline after OFAC sanctions were placed on them in July 2022. In the chart below, you may see proof volume from infrastructure lowering in the last quarter, which is again due to proof aggregation practices from zk-rollups. I believe we may see ZKP activity rise from private DeFi applications. Dark pools such as Renegade may spring up in activity, but their settlement activity will be limited to L2s. Economies of Proofs As more rollups and applications rely on zkVMs for verifiable computing and privacy, the demand for ZK proofs will rise. We’re starting to see this uptick in demand, and this increase in appetite for verified computations will be served by next-gen zkVMs such as R0, SP1, and Nexus that run efficient and composable proving systems. ZkVMs tap into proof markets that pool multiple prover networks together to serve this appetite. These prover networks, composed of AISCs, GPUs, and other specialized hardware, compete to deliver proofs faster and cheaper. With increased proof demand, proof markets have economies of scale that drive down the marginal cost for generating each proof. This could incentivize provers to invest more in dedicated hardware such as VPUs (Verifiable Processing Units), ASICs, or GPUs. With costs being driven down, especially with recursive aggregation systems like Nebra, more developers, rollups, and applications may rely on zkVMs. This could lead to verifiable computing, confidential or otherwise, being closer to standard practice and not just a niche advantage, further increasing demand. This is already quite evident, as seen with the adoption of ZK above, and will only increase in the months and years to come. With more requests flowing into proof markets, individual zkVMs and prover networks will invest in improving their efficiency. We will see more experiments with cutting-edge proof systems, better compression techniques, and advanced cryptographic primitives that reduce the overhead of proof generation and verification. Improved zkVMs, in turn, lower barriers for developers, encouraging even broader usage of zero-knowledge proofs across a range of unique applications and rollups. Proof markets such as Fermah, Risc Zero’s Boundless, and Gevulot, among several others, play the role of orchestrating demand and supply between rollups and applications seeking proofs, and prover networks running zkVMs, zkEVMs, and custom circuits on provers. Their mechanism design will help price proofs and open doors for competition among provers. With all this competition in place, proof markets can build moats to defend their market share. Better liveness for proof generation will lead to more demand flowing into that particular proof market. This also means that provers don’t sit idle and can generate better ROI for the investments made on hardware, among other things. It also helps if the proof market can satisfy a diverse range of proof demands. This ensures increased utilization rates of machines. Provers will continue integrating with proof markets that help them get the best ROI. Over time, I see this turning into a self-reinforcing cycle. More adoption of zero-knowledge proofs leads to larger proof markets and networks that have economies of scale and price reduction. Lower proof costs and improved performance encourage more dapps, rollups, and infrastructure layers to integrate with zkVMs. Proving systems continuously improve, reducing complexity and further expanding the pool of potential use cases. This cycle is already in motion, and we will soon be able to witness its indicators. For specific applications, relying on proof markets may not be in their best interests. For example, Renegade, a dark pool on Arbitrum that has been live for over 3 months, processing ~$700K in volume, produces ZKPs attesting order matches within its orderbook that help settle user orders. If Renegade were to hand off proving to a proof market, prover nodes could view specific orders, defeating the purpose of using a dark pool in the first place. For most consumer-facing ZK applications, like Renegade, lightweight-proof systems are sufficient; they aren’t computationally expensive. As we’ve seen with most markets like block building and sequencing, they tend to centralize because of the cost and latency benefits they provide. Until decentralized proof networks are fast enough, we may see similar levels of centralization even with prover networks as they may offer faster and cheaper proofs. Practical FHE with Zama & Inco Network FHE simply allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first. In the last 2-4 years, FHE has come a long way from being theoretical to being capable of real-world implementations. However, running FHE programs on-chain is highly inefficient due to the computational intensity, the noise, and significant delays imposed by FHE operations. It is more practical to leverage FHE through an off-chain coprocessor by offloading resource-intensive computations to be performed in specialized environments such as fheEVMs and even utilizing purpose-built hardware such as VPUs (Verifiable Processing Units) such as those being built by Fabric Cryptography. On this end, Zama and Inco Network have pushed the frontier by working their fheEVMs. They allow smart contracts to work on encrypted data while maintaining privacy of shared states. Data can be programmably encrypted, or decrypted as developers specify, enabling access control based on specific use cases across EVM networks. When users encrypt data using their public key, their private key is not stored with a single validator. Instead, it is distributed across the entire validator network. The key management system relies on MPC, so to decrypt data, a threshold signature is required, meaning that x of n validators must agree to decrypt it. Inco’s Confidential ERC20 Framework One can simply make global transfers and swaps in seconds on blockchains but the extent to which people rely on blockchains is limited in one capacity. As they are inherently transparent, any and all activity on-chain is traceable and attributable to specific entities or people. For example, on-chain payroll is not as convenient as it sounds. Employees can easily figure out how much their colleagues are being paid by searching their company’s wallet address. The same can be applied to vendors or service provider payments. What if newer vendors or service providers figure out exactly how much you paid for your previous engagement? This would land the company in a pretty chaotic situation. That is why we draw the line between anonymity and confidentiality, as seen below. The confidential ERC20 framework builds on the existing ERC20 standard by adding confidentiality as a feature. It is now possible to Confidentially mint and burn new tokens Wrap existing tokens to be confidential Encrypt balances and transfers with access control Let us take a look at an example of a confidential transfer of a wrapped token with transfer rules Bob initiates a transfer of ERC20 tokens and wraps them into cERC20 with hidden balances using FHE A smart contract initiates verification to check if the user’s address is in a block list publicly and then verifies if the sender/receiver’s age and transfer limit are within bounds privately with the help of FHE algorithms Once all transfer rules have been verified, verify the encrypted amount the transfer is finalized P2P confidential transfers are just one of many potential applications of programmable encryption. This approach could also extend to confidential token vesting, where transparency is required to show how many tokens are being vested over a specific duration to the team as a whole, while preserving privacy regarding the exact amounts allocated to individual employees. This broadens the scope of how creative developers can get when creating consumer-facing applications. It is only a matter of time until we have Uniswap v4 hook for confidential swaps using cERC20s. Confidential AMMs, dark pools, lending, and blind auctions only scratch the surface. Dynamic MPC Becomes More Accessible MPC allows multiple parties to compute over different inputs privately to arrive at an output. There are a range of different MPC protocols with their trade-offs across adversary models, trust assumptions, computational overhead, communication models, and privacy guarantees. Dishonest-majority protocols like SPDZ and MASCOT are more advanced MPC protocols that tolerate a higher fraction of compromised participants but have greater computational overheads. Honest-majority schemes such as BGW and Shamir Secret Sharing are relatively less compute-heavy but are less secure. Trust assumptions can shift from requiring a reliable dealer like Beaver triples to not trusting any single party with BWG or SPDZ. Communication models range from preprocessing-heavy frameworks (SPDZ) to synchronous (garbled circuits, BGW) and asynchronous models (HoneyBadger), each optimizing for different use cases with their own trade-offs. As you can see, these are one too many complexities for teams just looking to ship and scale their applications. MPC co-processors such as Fairblock, Gateway, Stoffle, and Arcium handle a lot of heavy lifting under the hood. They abstract away the cryptographic complexity of dealing with multiple MPC protocols—no need to choose between SPDZ, MASCOT, or BGW yourself. They also manage the underlying infrastructure that keeps these protocols running and coordinates a decentralized network of nodes to ensure threshold decryption works as intended. Co-processors can completely abstract complexities of privacy-preserving, verifiable computations, so developers don’t have to spin up their own distributed networks, reinvent secure key management, or become overnight MPC experts. World Chain World has been operating at the intersection of Crypto x AI. In July 2023, World had iris scanning stations across all major countries. Since then, over 8.7M people have scanned their iris, creating their own unique world IDs. The orb processes iris images on-device and converts them into an iris code which represents the iris texture. This code is stored in an encrypted form across multiple parties using secure multi-party computation (SMPC) built in collaboration with TACEO. In order to verify that each iris is, in fact, unique and not just the same person creating multiple IDs, every new iris code has to be verified against all the existing iris codes. If this were to be done using conventional methods, it would compromise user privacy. With SMPC, each node holds only partial secret shares of every stored iris code. When a new code arrives, they collaboratively perform computations directly on these shares without decrypting anything. They collectively combine their partial results to produce a final match score, revealing only whether the new iris is unique, not any underlying iris data. This is by far the largest MPC network in terms of users. A few things to note about how World operates With WorldIDs, World Chain will be differentiated between humans and bots. This is increasingly important as we’re seeing AI agents become more active onchain and offchain. Verified users can periodically claim grants in WLD tokens. So far, over 370M WLD have been given out as grants to users. While financial activity is yet to rise on World chain, I believe that its 8M WorldID user base is a dry powder for real-world consumer applications to leverage. All ZK, FHE, MPC, TEE coprocessors will target DeFi use-cases because that is where they’ll find users and liquidity. Fully autonomous, verifiable AI agents will have to rely on a mix of TEE, MPC, FHE solutions. A couple of interesting developments to follow: Dark Pools, UniswapV4, CowSwap hooks – Renegade A range of different private DeFi uses, starting with private lending strategies and portfolio optimization – Stoffle, Fairblock Fully autonomous, verifiable AI agents such as TEE_HEE, an AI agent with its own twitter account. The scope of use-cases will rapidly expand – Nous Research, Flashbots, Teleport Biometrics and other personal data being ZK verified onchain to support myriad of consumer facing applications – World, Reclaim ZK’s Exponential Era 2024 has been a big year for zk, and a number of developments emerged in all layers of the stack. Many of these are set to come into production and we’ll explore how this convergence will affect different areas. We’ll begin with zkVMs, which are democratizing ZK development by allowing any developer to build ZK applications without cryptographic expertise. Combined with rapidly falling costs, these zkVMs are positioned to challenge optimistic rollups’ dominance, offering superior security guarantees and seamless interoperability. We’ll then see how zk is addressing fragmentation and enabling true unification across different rollups and creating a fluid user experience. We’ll also see the impact of zk on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. The rise of “ZK-first” L1s represents another shift – these are chains fundamentally take a different route, with zk verification as their core primitive, delivering horizontal scalability while maintaining validator accessibility and composability. Finally, we’ll see how advances in hardware acceleration and proof systems are creating multiplicative performance gains across the ecosystem, from specialized chips and GPU optimization to revolutionary approaches with smaller field sizes. zkVMs zkVMs have emerged as one of the biggest shifts and enablers of zk in the past year. Previously, teams who wanted benefits of zk, typically the rollups, needed cryptographers. Then the core primitive here was a circuit for generating proofs. This severely limited the use of zk to only those teams. The circuits were handwritten and had a larger surface area of bugs. The optimization was ad hoc. zkVMs have changed the game. A zkVM defines the instruction set and other things like memory, registers, etc. to run computations and generate proofs for it. It first runs the computation and records the changes in memory after applying the instructions. A proof of its correct execution is then generated. Continuations was a big breakthrough in zkVMs which is a standard practice now. Before this, the memory requirements for proof generation of entire computation made proof generation difficult for even a single transaction. But in continuations, large computation is divided into smaller parts and proofs for each is generated in parallel and recursively composed. This has made proof generation for entire Ethereum blocks possible. The main unlock of zkVMs is how it expands the market for developers. Unlike before, they no longer have to learn a new language to develop zk applications. Now anyone who knows Rust or other familiar high level language can get proofs generated using a zkVM. This opens up a huge developer base that can use zk for scaling or privacy. Transforming applications or programs to use zk capabilities has become significantly easier. We’re seeing precisely this effect on the application space. All sorts of applications other than rollups are getting converted to its zk version – Bridges, Light Clients, OP Rollups, Ethereum Block proving, Individual Smart Contract acceleration, TEE attestations, etc. Applications can now focus on the business logic, while still getting the benefits of zk. A growing number of applications also means reductions in cost and latency, because the larger the proof demand, the better the costs and latency due to amortization across all the volume. One way to categorize zkVMs is using the Instruction set that it proves Hardware based ISA like RiscV, MIPS, WASM (RiscZero, Succinct, zkWASM, zkm) Custom ISA (Valida, Binius) – These create new instruction set which is zk friendly Custom ISA + Custom Language (Cairo) Currently RiscV based zkVMs are leading in the market, but there are a number of others entering the market next year. We’ve already seen a 10x improvement in cost in a year since their launch. The current costs for proving single transactions using zkVMs is around 0.1 cent. Next year we’ll see another 10x improvement in cost or even more. This is a combined effect of improvements through proof systems, hardware acceleration and zkVM optimizations. There’s a Moore’s law like progression in zk proof efficiency in action here. ISA choice has a big impact on zkVM costs and efficiency, especially in the long run. When looking at proof costs in zkVMs, we need to consider both how many execution cycles are generated and the cost per cycle. While RISC-V based zkVMs all generate the same number of cycles, Cairo’s custom ISA helps Kakarot zkEVM generate about 5 times fewer cycles when proving Ethereum blocks. Combined with Cairo’s optimization for proof generation, this makes Kakarot roughly 10 times cheaper. This difference is particularly significant because it matches the current difference between an OP rollup transaction and zkVM based OP rollup. This means that when it goes live, the OP rollups have a simple choice – become zk at the same cost with its benefits – a no brainer. Performance for a zkVM can be considered across different dimensions: proof generation cost, proof size, verifier cost, verifier size, proof generation latency. Out of these, proof generation cost is the big one because that’s the main hurdle for adoption from the customers. The reason for this is the demand upstream: If OP rollups want to shift to zk, they need the costs equal to or lower than their current costs. Users are generally willing to wait a little compared to paying higher costs. Current zkVMs are optimizing these by tweaking internal components. In zkVMs, we have a main CPU circuit and lookup circuits to carry out each kind of operation instead of one giant circuit. Between the parts of the computation, memory consistency has to be checked as well. zkVM proving costs are reduced by Having an Improved VM circuit Using efficient proof systems Using smaller fields (operations are more efficient) Efficient use of Lookups (reduced columns and circuit size) Improved Memory arguments Use of accelerator circuits/ precompiles Optimized GPU acceleration Use of folding Engineering and implementation improvements (like implementing it in C instead of Rust) The performance gains for zkVMs over the long term can be divided in two parts In the short term (next year), zkVMs will be focusing on use of accelerator circuits, lookups, better memory argument, and GPU implementations rather than incorporating new proof systems, fields and folding, etc. This is because the engineering focused performance gains are easier and less risky than incorporating new proof systems, fields, using ASICs, etc. This is especially true because these things are still moving fast. These will contribute more in the longer term, once there is standardization and stability. This means that we have a long and continuous pipeline of improvements coming to the zkVMs – through zkVM engineering improvements as well as underlying stack improvements. Precompiles Another component which is considered to have a big impact on performance is Precompiles. SP1 has a number of these precompiles live Secp256r1 precompile Poseidon2 BabyBear precompile BLS12-381 precompile Keccak precompile But what are these precompiles? These are essentially specialized circuits for special computations that plug into the zkVM circuit. These circuits are run natively on hardware and have better efficiency. So instead of generating proofs for these computations through a VM and its instructions, precompiles do this without its overhead. Accelerators for common operations like keccak hashing, signature verification and curve operations will boost performance next year. These operations are intensive and precompiles will contribute to 6-10x improvement in these. RiscZero also has accelerators for SHA256, ECDSA signature verification and Big integer arithmetic and are working on “Programmable Precompiles”, delivering 200x improvements in algebraic operations. Execution and Witness generation before actual proving is another large bottleneck. Unlike proving, which can be parallelized using continuations, execution is a sequential process. Fabric’s VPU has made improvements on this part, which we’ll see in the hardware acceleration section later. zkVMs are also not running on efficient GPU implementations, and there is a lot of improvement left on the table which will be bridged next year. In the longer term, other zkVMs are going to enter the market JOLT / LASSO – zkVM based on lookups only and combining Binius Irreducible / Polygon – zkVM based on Binius proof system, efficient Polynomial Commitments, vertically integrated with their ASICs Valida – Custom ISA based zkVM Polygon RiscV ZIVM Ceno – zkVM by Scroll using proofs of parallel execution Kakarot zkEVM – EVM prover for all networks using CairoVM and Stwo prover The zkVM market is primarily competing on cost and there is no direct moat. Price performance is going to be key, and making certain design decisions from the start might give approaches an advantage in the longer term. For instance, Custom ISAs definitely have edge in terms of performance and would win in longer term, but they do have challenges with compiler and tooling. There are few projects taking this route – Valida, Cairo etc and compared to RiscV zkVMs their performance is much better as we can see from the benchmarks. Precompiles, though a special feature will become a standard industry practice and improve performance of all the zkVMs. As we slowly move towards Snarkification of Ethereum execution and consensus layer, it would be preferred to have different implementations of zkVMs similar to how we have client diversity in execution and consensus client. Platform strategy RiscV zkVMs are getting crowded, commoditized and there is a need for differentiation of switching costs. Similar to client diversity on Ethereum, we’d need diversity in zkVM implementations and being one of RiscV zkVMs would be tough. RiscZero is building a platform around its zkVM to build switching costs for the users. This is a good move. RiscZero’s platform is called Boundless and integrates a number of their offerings like – A Decentralized Prover market Steel – acceleration of individual contracts on Ethereum or any other chain zkVMs for EVM, SVM and other altVMs Light clients like Blobsteam for Celestia Proof Aggregator Settlement contracts Network effects emerge from aggregating proving demand across diverse zkVM applications that they have access to. As more developers build on RiscZero’s zkVM, this creates a larger pool of proving needs that can be routed to their decentralized proof market. Higher proving demand enables better capacity utilization and cost amortization, leading to lower prices. These improved economics attract more developers, creating a feedback loop. The proof aggregation layer strengthens this effect – by combining proofs across applications, it reduces costs for all participants. The more applications in the ecosystem, the more opportunities for aggregation. Rather than developers piecing together and managing multiple systems, they get a simplified interface to the full stack. This reduces development complexity while preserving flexibility in the unified platform, giving it a switching cost benefit. We like this strategy of building moats when proving costs could commoditize the market. The pricing wars in zkVMs will ultimately benefit rollups, applications and finally take zk to mainstream next year. Impact of zkVMs zkVMs as an abstraction layer are leading to a number of changes in the way in which applications are developed, their limits and solving hardware acceleration of zk proofs. Developer Access and Convergence of Software Paradigms While zkVMs initially appear to drive accessibility through a feedback loop of mainstream language, better tooling and more developers, their true transformation runs deeper. They’re creating a bridge between two previously isolated domains: the rich heritage of software engineering patterns and the privacy and scaling capacity of zk proofs. Circuit-based development made it impossible to apply decades of evolved software practices to ZK applications, while keeping ZK’s powerful verification and privacy primitives locked away from traditional software. zkVMs dissolve this barrier, enabling a two-way exchange where software engineering wisdom flows into ZK development, while ZK’s core principles reshape how we build conventional applications. This isn’t merely about accessibility – it’s about a new unified discipline that harnesses the combined power of both domains. Implementation Compression The shift from manual circuit design to automated compilation through zkVMs represents a fundamental change in how ZK applications are built. This helps with composability of components because they’re no longer tied down to circuits. Developers can focus on providing these legos, and others on assembling them for more complex applications without worrying about circuits or cryptography. A developer building a privacy-preserving voting system can use standard components for authentication, vote counting, and verification, focusing on the unique aspects of their application rather than reimplementing basic cryptographic primitives Optimization Compression Each different ZK circuit (whether it’s for EVM execution, ML inference, or privacy-preserving computations) has its own unique pattern of computation. This creates a dilemma: Do you build specialized hardware for specific types of circuits (limiting your market) or try to build flexible hardware that can handle any circuit (sacrificing efficiency). zkVMs transform the problem. Instead of arbitrary circuits, we can design hardware that accelerates one type of computation – zkVM instruction set. This provides a fixed target for acceleration that stays stable over years, and optimization becomes predictable and simpler. This shifts the problem from “how do we accelerate unknown computation patterns?” to “how do we best execute this specific instruction set?” This creates increasing returns to scale: As more developers use zkVMs, the tools get better, more components become available, and hardware optimization becomes more effective, making it even more attractive for new developers to enter the ecosystem. This positive feedback loop is similar to what happened with cloud computing – each layer of abstraction and standardization enabled new use cases and attracted more developers. Applications Leveraging zkVMs Transitioning OP Rollups to ZK Rollups The shift from OP rollups to ZK rollups is one of the biggest drivers for zkVM adoption. The current OP rollup architecture has clear drawbacks – complex fraud proofs, interoperability that depends on bonds, and long withdrawal windows. These limitations make a strong case for moving to ZK technology. Right now, the only real barrier stopping OP rollups from adopting zkVMs is the cost factor. Running transactions through zkVM-based systems is about ten times more expensive than traditional OP rollups. But here’s what’s changing: this cost gap is exactly going to be improved next year – since we’re expecting 10x improvement in zkVM proving cost next year. Once zkVM-based solutions reach price parity with OP rollups, the choice to switch becomes straightforward. It always expected that OP rollups will eventually become ZK-based. With the economics finally aligning, this transition is set to kick off next year. There are other benefits of zkVM based rollups compared to circuit based. zk rollups were maintained by cryptography heavy teams which wrote the circuits. Compared to that, zkVM based rollups don’t have the problems of updatability and maintenance. The attack surface for bugs (etc) reduces compared to having circuits. In circuit based zkEVMs Keccak hashing, signature verification proofs are quite hard. Using precompiles in zkVMs makes this 6-10x more efficient. In terms of migration, zkVM allows OP rollups to shift to being full zk rollups in less than 2k lines of code. It also takes almost the same on chain verification cost. The difference is the 2-3x cost of Ethereum transaction for generation of proofs – out of which, 80% of the cost is in execution. Compared to OP rollups, the withdrawal window will keep decreasing with decrease in proof generation times. Again here, the cost prohibits the frequent batching of proofs and their settlement, but this is on a downward trajectory. This means the time to withdrawal will trend to zero – aggressively starting next year a step closer to seamless experience of a single chain. Though projects are experimenting with hybrid proofs, marginal improvement in terms of withdrawal window (because the window needs to be wider to allow dispute and zk proofs are a small fraction of actual window) and falling costs mean that full zk rollups would make more sense. Another difference would be in interop between the rollups. Though interop between OP stack rollups is one of the perks, they need nodes to be run for each rollup. zk stack rollups will have zk light clients, Agglayer like solutions which would be faster, less expensive and trustless. But as zkVM makes zk rollups more easy to develop, just a good implementation would stop to be a differentiator. Added functionalities like privacy, client side proving, ecosystem support etc would matter more moving ahead. We’ll see the majority of rollups converted into zk by the end of next year, and this will be facilitated by the cost parity of running a zk rollup as cheap as an optimistic rollup. Interoperability The rollup centric roadmap has created fragmentation and a single chain experience is needed asap. To make matters worse, each of the rollup clusters are building their own interoperability standards. Agglayer aims to be neutral and will lead to improved user experience. The first component of the AggLayer, specifically the unified bridge, is live. Because each of the rollups has its own bridge, there is a lack of fungibility between tokens. This leads to capital inefficiency and bad user experience. Agglayer has a shared bridge, solving for this. Having a single shared bridge also introduces points of vulnerabilities which is handled using Pessimistic proofs and accounting checks. One of the main advantages of Agglayer is that it would allow rollups and chains to interact faster than Ethereum finality – so essentially being unaffected by the slow speed of base layer finality. It uses rollup state commitments and their enforcement in settlement via zk proofs for this. So, the unified liquidity, faster async and sync interop will bring a single chain experience. All of this will be accelerated using zkVMs and hardware acceleration next year. Fabric is working on releasing their VPUs next year, which will accelerate the Agglayer proof generation. More on Fabric and VPUs in later sections. So we get this nice safety layer that solves the liquidity, sync and async interoperability problem between rollups via cryptography and it gets acceleration via hardware – both, next year. Agglayer also works with Espresso, allowing the block builder to build rollup blocks simultaneously, and provide safety using its pessimistic proofs for safe preconfs. Behind the scenes, Agglayer has merkle trees to track withdrawals and balances for each rollup, Ethereum mainchain and a combined merkle tree for them all. They are called LER, MER and GER. The GER is passed on to all the rollups to check, verified against them, and aggregated to reduce costs. When rollups interact they create commitments to their state and while settled the verifier checks if this commitment is followed. So the rollup finality is dependent on them following their commitments. So, all in all, Agglayer is accelerated on multiple levels: zkVM optimizations GPU proving and VPU proving Commitments and proofs for even faster guarantees than Ethereum L1 (rollups can start interop before settlement) Another area where interop gets a boost using zkVMs is light clients between L2s. There are a number of implementations of zk light clients using zkVMs: Celestia Blobstream for DA (SP1) Celestia zkIBC, proofs for the zk rollups Gnosis light client (SP1) SP1-Helios (which is a mutli-chain light client focused on L2s) and a few others Helios started out as a light client 2 years back and now has extended its support to OP stack chains and other rollups in its roadmap. It’s a multi-chain light client to make interop simpler. Currently, Helios runs on sync committee, like most of the light clients, introducing trust assumptions and lower security (sync committee has 512 validators only that are rotated). Helios’ zkVM implementation allows rollups to just verify zk proofs of a light client running inside a zkVM, reducing the gas costs to run them as smart contracts. Polyhedra has done some interesting work on accelerating sumcheck proofs using GPUs. They’re also working on proofs for the entire validator set instead of just the sync committee. This would turn it into a fully trustless light client. Hopefully these developments could be integrated with Helios for trustless bridging between the L1 and L2s. Again here, improvements in zkVMs, proof systems and hardware acceleration plays a major role to make this feasible and performant. Espresso is live, and Agglayer’s first component is live and next year, this combination will improve the user experience. This will be followed by reduced costs by aggregating proofs, zkVM optimizations and hardware acceleration using VPU. The combination of Espresso, Agglayer and light clients will be the first steps towards a single chain experience next year. ZK by Ecosystem Ethereum There are longer term plans for snarkifying the execution and consensus layers. Snarkification of execution means that builders create blocks inside zkVMs and proofs of blocks are verified instead of re-running all the transactions. This reduces the load on validators as lighter machines can verify blocks and can have higher gas limits. Snarkification of consensus layer focuses on improving the efficiency of signature aggregation. The current system requires collecting signatures from all validators before submission, creating a bottleneck. The proposed snarkified approach would enable validators to sign with just their local peer group quickly, with these partial signature sets being aggregated through services. This would make the system more fault-tolerant and enable faster finality, potentially achieving it with just 60-70% participation. These are longer term goals, still in specification phase. Main bottlenecks for these would be to generate proofs for blocks. Current latency is not much of a bottleneck compared to the cost. It is possible to have a large cluster of GPUs and get faster proofs, but the challenge is to make this economically viable – meaning faster proof generation on consumer hardware. Kakarot zkEVM will be generating proofs for L2s and EVM chains and is working on generating sub 4 second proofs for entire blocks at a cost of a few cents per block by the end of 2025. It will use CairoVM, Stwo (new prover from Starkware), Circle Starks and other improvements. The key insight is that optimizing both cost and latency requires addressing the fundamental efficiency of the proving system itself, rather than just throwing more hardware at the problem. More on this in proof systems and hardware acceleration sections. Hardware acceleration and proof system improvements will play a big role in reducing the validator load in coming year. Bitcoin Bitcoin’s evolution in 2024 marks a pivotal moment. While its fundamental value as a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value has driven widespread adoption as a reserve asset, zk will dramatically expand its capabilities. The convergence of zkVMs, advanced bridging solutions, and protocol improvements suggests 2025 will be a transformative year for Bitcoin’s technical capabilities and its role in DeFi. Bitcoin L2s are evolving beyond simple payment channels to full zk-Rollups, offering orders of magnitude higher throughput while inheriting Bitcoin’s security. This shift is enabled by major breakthroughs in proof systems: Circle Starks achieved 125x faster proving speeds on consumer hardware. This will be used by Starkware for their Bitcoin Rollup. Smaller field sizes, reducing computational overhead – Binius, M31. Development of BitVM, BitVM2, BitVMX and OP_CAT frameworks for verification of zk snarks on Bitcoin Hardware acceleration leading to 10x efficiency gains in 2025. Bridging Innovations on Bitcoin The critical challenge of trustless Bitcoin bridging saw three distinct approaches emerge in 2024, each pushing boundaries in different ways: BitVM2 and Strata BitVM2 was proposed this year, and we have several implementations. Its used in bridging using validity proofs and optimization of Bitcoin’s existing script capabilities. Alpen Labs’ Strata implementation shows how this enables trustless 1:1 Bitcoin bridging without protocol changes. It combines validity proofs, emulated covenants, and economic incentives through operator collateral and challenge mechanisms. With active development and optimization underway, production-ready implementations are expected in early 2025, changing how assets move between Bitcoin, L2s and other chains. OP_CAT Bridge Evolution The proposed OP_CAT opcode addition has shown potential using StarkWare’s demonstration of STARK verification on Bitcoin’s Signet. This allows direct covenant implementation and efficient transaction batching, offering a cleaner path to trustless bridging. While its activation would depend on Bitcoin community consensus, growing support suggests possible inclusion in 2025. The key advantage lies in its potential for near-instant bridging and settlement for rollups, but careful consideration of security implications remains crucial. ColliderScript Exploration ColliderScript, developed by Blockstream researchers, proves that covenant-like functionality is possible on Bitcoin today without protocol modifications. Using sophisticated cryptographic techniques involving hash collisions, it shows untapped potential within Bitcoin’s existing script capabilities. While current implementation costs (estimated at $50M per transaction) make it impractical for immediate use, this theoretical breakthrough is driving important research into optimization techniques. The shows how innovation can emerge from working within Bitcoin’s constraints than changing them. The parallel development of these approaches suggests 2025 will be a pivotal year for Bitcoin bridging. Each solution offers distinct advantages: BitVM2 provides immediate practicality, OP_CAT offers protocol-level improvements, and ColliderScript demonstrates theoretical possibilities. This diversity of approaches strengthens the ecosystem. Bitcoin’s Next Chapter These solutions are coming together for something powerful. zkVMs based on RISC-V or CairoVM provide the computational engine for L2s. They work with the bridging solutions to ensure that Bitcoin can be securely transferred and utilized within these more expressive environments. New Proof systems enable efficient verification and hardware acceleration makes it performant. This enables expressive applications while preserving Bitcoin’s core properties. Users can now access decentralized lending and borrowing protocols, along with Bitcoin-native DeFi systems that eliminate the need for intermediaries. The Layer 2 solutions bring advanced smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin, while also enabling privacy-preserving financial applications that maintain the network’s fundamental security and trustlessness. The next year will see Multiple production-ready bridging solutions. Significant reduction in proof generation costs. Emergence of zkVM-based Bitcoin applications. Projects like Lava, which are building DeFi applications on Bitcoin L2s, will benefit from these advancements in bridging and zkVM technology. Potential protocol improvements enhancing these capabilities. Increased demand for Bitcoin, not just as a store of value, but as a productive asset within L2 ecosystem. This suggests Bitcoin is entering a new phase where it not only serves as a store of value, but as a foundation for DeFi. The parallel development of multiple approaches provides redundancy and optionality, increasing the likelihood of successful implementation while maintaining Bitcoin’s security-first ethos. These developments don’t just add features – they fundamentally expand what’s possible with Bitcoin while preserving its core properties of decentralization and security. Solana zk helps Solana with its own, different challenge: managing explosive state growth while maintaining its high performance. With over 500 million accounts growing by ~1 million daily, Solana is taking a different approach to zk – not primarily for scaling throughput, but for state management and cost optimization. This rapid growth has created significant challenges for state management. It now requires snapshot sizes of more than 70GB, which impacts node synchronization. Validators need more than 32GB of RAM only for account indexing, resulting in escalating costs for both validators and application developers. These things point to need for managing the load as well as cost for both validators as well as applications. To address these challenges, Solana has implemented zk compression for state management. This approach differs from other chains that use zk primarily for throughput scaling. The compression achieves a 5000x reduction in state storage costs through several key innovations. The state is stored off-chain in Solana’s ledger space while maintaining on-chain Merkle roots for verification. It is able to get 128-byte proof sizes through compression while preserving parallel transaction processing when states don’t overlap. Importantly, it maintains full atomic composability, allowing transactions with both compressed and regular accounts to be combined atomically. Solana has improved its infrastructure by adding zk syscalls this year for on-chain proof verification. These include Poseidon hash functions for efficient ZK operations, alt_bn128 syscalls for proof verification, and enhanced runtime support for elliptic curve operations. This infrastructure upgrade provides a foundation for ZK-based applications to manage state, enhance privacy, and enable scaling through network extensions. This infrastructure upgrade creates a foundation for ZK-based applications, to manage state, add privacy and scaling via Network extensions. The ecosystem is using these solutions in different ways. Wallet providers like Backpack are providing rent-free token storage, while Dark Protocol is developing privacy-preserving applications. Social applications such as Tribe are using compression for token distribution, and Helius is developing tooling and indexing solutions. Apart from that, we’re seeing zkSVMs being developed by running an SVM instance inside a zkVM (RiscZero and SP1) and allowing it for “network extensions” to quickly ship to production and settling via validity proofs. These implementations show that zk is getting adopted in different ways on Solana, solving for different problems apart from scaling. zk on Solana is new and looks promising. Next year, we would see Further optimization of state compression techniques, leading to further lower costs for applications, lower burden on validators Integration with cross-chain data availability solutions using things like Blobstream running in zkVMs like SP1 Expansion of privacy-preserving applications Improved validator economics through compressed state zk First L1s Maturation of zk and its performance has led to a new generation of L1s which are fundamentally taking a different route, based on zk as a first class citizen. All the L1s till now have been designed with re-execution of transactions as a core primitive. But with improved zk performance, easy development using zkVMs, we’re seeing new L1s using verification of zk proofs as a core primitive. These new L1s generally have shared accounts/state or completely separate state needing minimal co-ordination between them. The key insight here is, because the state is separate, it can manage its own ordering. This frees up the base layer to experiment with consensus and not rely on execution at all. These new consensus systems are much lighter, highly parallelizable and horizontally scalable. These consensus mechanisms don’t manage total ordering like in other large chains, and instead only have partial ordering. They have parallel block building (different validators creating blocks at same time) and dissemination of blocks for parallel consensus on them. The direct effects of this on the L1 are: No or minimal need for Execution on Base chain No or minimal need for Total Ordering on Base chain Local ordering by Rollups and value capture Fast & Light Consensus Horizontally scalable Execution Horizontally scalable Consensus New state models to account for unified but not totally ordered transactions This translates into reduction in the amount of work a validator does on the base layer, but at the same time leading to better composability, better local control, and high performance. On Ethereum there is a split on whether to make the L1 faster or keeping the validators decentralized. In these cases, they’re able to do both. The validator requirements remain light because it only needs to verify proofs and has a light and fast consensus. The L1 is fast because the reduced consensus is parallelizable and scalable, because weaker machines don’t have to re-execute transactions. It just needs a quorum, which is very fast. So the validator requirements is low, at the same time base layer performance and overall throughput is high. In these designs, execution using rollups doesn’t have fragmentation, and the network effects are shared with the rollups. We cannot go into each of these designs in depth, but they are more or less similar: Delta – Shared assets, State and liquidity on the base layer with local execution, light consensus and zk verification Celestia – zkAccounts, lazybridging Hyle – Pipelined proofs, State commitments only onchain, light consensus InfinityVM – Enshrined zk coprocessors with all reorging or none Pod – light consensus, zk verification of rollups Celestia has adopted zk for enabling network effects and interop between its rollups. Celestia doesn’t want to add execution capabilities on base layer to reduce the state bloat and maximize its DA capacity. Instead, its introducing a zkIBC light client and zk accounts on the base layer. zk accounts corresponding to any program verifies if the program execution is valid and moves funds based on it. This is extended to the state transition functions of Rollup. These are run inside SP1 zkVM to generate proofs and get them verified using the zk IBC light client and zk account. This allows trustless bridging with fast finality (because Celestia has Single Slot finality). Here, the interop is bottlenecked only by proof generation times. And again, zkVMs and all related optimizations in zk make this continually improving. So looking ahead, we will see L1 approaches that have these benefits, challenging the tradeoff space for L1s They have low validator requirements They have fast base layer performance They allow network effects through sharing assets/ state and fast or no interop between them This is unlocked using zk, zkVMs and acceleration of proof generation Further Advancements in ZK Hardware acceleration Because of Continuations, proof generation is parallelizable, but it is slow on CPUs. Hardware acceleration is crucial for zk proof generation, and understanding the technical constraints and market dynamics helps explain why certain solutions are gaining traction. The generation of zkp relies heavily on operations like MSMs (large integer arithmetic), NTTs (polynomial evaluations and FFTs) and hashing. CPUs are not particularly optimized for these operations. Modern GPUs and ASICs provide impressive raw computing power to handle these calculations quickly. However, they often hit a significant roadblock: memory bandwidth. This becomes particularly problematic for memory-bound operations that require constant shuffling of data between different memory levels. While pure computational tasks that minimize data movement can run at blazing speeds, memory operations are different. When a GPU or ASIC needs to access memory—especially global memory—it can slow down dramatically, sometimes running 50 times slower or even worse compared to pure computation. This speed difference creates a major bottleneck in generating zk-proofs, and finding optimization approaches that can strike the right balance between computational power and memory usage are important. It is also important to share that these bottlenecks are shared between GPUs and ASICs, unless they have some onbound CPU and high memory on chip. zk proof acceleration is divided into few approaches: GPUs – Ingonyama, Snarkify FPGAs ASICs – Cysic, Ingonyama, Irreducible, Acceal, Fabric Apple Silicon / Consumer devices – Ingonyama Continuation, which breaks large computations into smaller parts with intermediate checks, tells us that proof generation is highly parallelizable—making GPUs a perfect fit. There is a general consensus that GPUs are going to win out in the short to medium term because of a number of factors They are cheaper compared to development of custom ASIC which needs a large demand to justify the fixed costs Widely available tooling and ecosystem Highly Performant and hard to compete with Far from being saturated in terms of performance Same bottlenecks for ASICs and GPUs – memory bound algorithms Harder memory design in ASICs Programmable and are flexible compared to ASICs For these reasons, the zkVMs are prioritizing proof acceleration using GPUs. zkVMs have lot of demand sitting on top of it, and therefore are important to the downstream proof market. Infact the choices of proof systems, optimization for zkVMs are heavily guided by their ease of parallelization on GPUs. Both SP1 and RiscZero, as well as rollup stacks like Scroll, zkSync have a focus on GPU implementations. But GPUs are a bit tricky, and having naive implementation keeps a lot of performance on the table. Deep hardware expertise is crucial for effective GPU acceleration. Most teams are converging with respect to algorithms and acceleration devices, proof systems and the key differentiator lies in optimization skill – specifically, the ability to implement solutions that fully understand and exploit hardware characteristics. This expertise in hardware-aware optimization can create performance gaps between otherwise similar implementations. This is clear if we look at the ZPrize winners and their approaches. Snarkify brings Niall Emmart’s background from Nvidia and years of GPU optimization experience. They were able to bring the proof generation time under a second. Both, the winning and the runner up implementations used the same approach, same algorithms. Yet there was a 50% difference in proof generation times for both – clearly indicating the role of experience and deep understanding. This breakthrough came through implementation changes: completely rewriting in C instead of Rust, eliminating unnecessary columns, and leveraging large GPU memory to minimize data movement. These optimization techniques aren’t just specific to their competition entry – they can be applied to proving systems in general, suggesting similar speedups are possible across the board. This demonstrates that we’re far from reaching the limits of GPU optimizations. Another factor that affects the cost of proof generation is the kind of GPUs that are used. Using cloud providers lead to higher costs, and having supply of GPUs leads to instant 10x cost difference. Snarkify has built a GPU capacity of 300, and generates proofs for Scroll, zkSync chains. But these are using larger primes, leading to higher costs. But, when shifted to smaller fields, would reap the benefits of lower costs. Similar observation confirms that building a GPU supply reduces costs by 4-10x. The key takeaway from this is that GPUs, with their underutilized potential and flexibility in programmability, emerge as the optimal choice. This is particularly true given that proof systems are still in flux and have yet to stabilize. Now, looking at ASICs. Just like CPUs are not great for AI computations and GPU are something new, in the long term we would want custom accelerator chips. But currently it is too early with the proof systems not being fixed. In this context, Fabric has an interesting take where, the ASICs they will produce will not be just for accelerating zk, but even for FHE and other programmable cryptographic computations. The VPUs are programmable, have less hardened things. It is reusable for things like MSMs, NTTs, Poseiden hashing etc. Generally CPU and GPUs work with 32 or 64 bits and for working with large primes they have to use multiple registers, handle carry between them and manage pipelining – leading to less efficiency and more cycles. The VPUs will have 384 bit width. By using 384 bit width each operation takes one cycle and is efficient. It is also compatible with smaller fields. So the same architecture handles variety of tasks like MSMs in larger fields, smaller fields and things like hashing efficiently. Its important to mention that witness generation is currently one of the largest bottlenecks, taking more time than actual proof generation. It is a sequential process needing back and forth between the CPU and GPU. And as we’ve seen before, data shuffling is much slower in GPU compared to actual computation. ASICs would face the same problems, since the memory technology is similar. To address this, the VPU has an on chip RiscV CPU for Witness generation. Having on chip CPU leads to 10x improvement in witness generation, which takes the processing capacity of VPUs to nearly 50Mhz (current state of the art is few Mhz) or more. VPU also has lot of memory on chip, and high bandwidth. This helps a lot with the workloads, as these are memory bound. Fabric is also developing a Kernel Development Kit for writing low level Kernels to accelerate the primitives like NTTs, MSMs and a higher level Graph Development Kit to combine these Kernels on a higher level. So, they’re working on the software support for their VPUs as well. These chips are expected to be shipped next year, and design of V2 is already in works. This should provide 10x or more improvement in proof generation costs for all workloads. So, for longer term, programmable cryptography (FHE and others) also gets benefits from acceleration using these VPUs. We didn’t cover other projects like Ingonyama and Cysic in depth, but they’re also building great things. Ingonyama is building an unified API for accelerating proofs using on hardware. This includes CPUs, GPUs, ASICs accessed through their API. They’re working on Apple Silicon support, which would be great for client side proofs because of its unified memory. They also have plans for their own ASIC based on a different ISA, but that is more in the long term. Cysic is building 2 varieties of ASICs – ZK Air and ZK Pro. ZK Air is a lightweight ASIC for client-side proof generation, while ZK Pro is relatively high-performance ASIC for server-side proof generation. Recently Cysic’s C1 chip was able to prove 1.3 Million keccak functions per second, which is about 100x faster compared to state of the art. This was using Sumchecks, GKR in collaboration with Polyhedra. This points towards a promising future for client side proving in the coming year when the C1 chip is expected to be released. Apart from this Binius is also looking to build ASIC for accelerating their Binius proofs, which are highly anticipated and expected to improve the proving costs by large margin. So on the hardware side, In the short term, GPUs dominate due to flexibility and market readiness. ASICs and VPUs may lead in the long term once proof standards stabilize, providing an efficiency leap. Competition and alliances may form around chip supply, engineering expertise, and integrated software toolchains. Cysic and Fabric are set to release their first batch of chips next year. So we should see an immediate bump in performance and on path towards incremental improvements going forward. Client side proofs would improve because of custom ASICs like Cysic’s ZK Air, Apple Silicon. This would benefit privacy applications. Server side proofs would improve by 10x or more initially on GPUs and later on Fabric ASICs in next year via implementation improvements only. This is not accounting for the proof system improvements. Most of the algorithms for zkps are Memory Bound, and we’d see movement towards end to end proof generation on the same hardware. Proof systems Binius Binius is a fundamental shift in SNARK design by addressing a core inefficiency in cryptographic protocols: the mismatch between computer hardware’s natural data processing and cryptographic design. While modern computers work with binary data in fixed sizes (8-bit bytes, 32-bit words, 64-bit words), SNARKs typically operate over large prime fields requiring 256-bit arithmetic, creating significant performance gaps. This insight follows a broader industry trend toward smaller fields. The movement began with Plonky2 introducing 64-bit fields, followed by systems like Baby Bear and M31 adopting 32-bit fields. M31’s practical implementation remained challenging until recent breakthroughs by the Polygon and Starkware teams. Binius takes this minimization to its logical conclusion, working with fields as small as 2 bits. The system’s architecture is built on binary tower fields – a hierarchical structure where each field builds upon the previous one. This approach offers two key advantages: First, at the hardware level, binary field arithmetic reduces to simple logic gates (XOR, AND) and bit shifts, operations already optimized in modern processors. Second, it eliminates the “embedding overhead” found in traditional SNARKs, where single bits often require full 256-bit field elements for security. Instead, Binius allows data to be represented in its natural form – bits as bits, bytes as bytes – creating perfect alignment between data representation and computation. These efficiency gains are important for polynomial commitments, a major bottleneck in zk proofs. Irreducible has leveraged these improvements for GPU-based proof generation, getting an 80% cost reduction compared to CPU implementations. Their new Vision Mark-32 hash function operates ten times faster than existing alternatives, making client-side proof generation increasingly feasible. Looking toward 2025, several developments are in progress. Irreducible is developing specialized CPU architecture for binary tower fields and ISA, though this remains a longer-term project. Memory usage is expected to decrease by 30-40%, and the technology is being integrated into various zkVMs, with both Irreducible and Jolt actively working on Binius-based implementations. As implementation costs continue to decrease, we can expect accelerated adoption across the zkVM ecosystem. https://x.com/eddylazzarin/status/1784922354931397077https://x.com/gakonst/status/1813255778889048285 https://x.com/eddylazzarin/status/1784922354931397077https://x.com/gakonst/status/1813255778889048285 Circle Starks and Stwo The second most important development that happened this year was Circle starks. As I mentioned, there is a move towards smaller fields and within it, the 32 bit fields are most interesting. This is because CPUs and GPUs use these lengths to compute. Using these, proof generation on consumer hardware becomes efficient. Currently, zkVMs use BabyBear field (another 32 bit field), but M31, which is used in Circle Starks is 1.3x faster than it. This is because working with numbers in this fields is much simpler, needing less cycles. Instead of calculation, often there is just rearrangement tricks in computations. The main technical challenge in implementing M31 was identifying a subgroup of order 2, essential for operations like polynomial evaluations, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), and FRI protocol. The breakthrough came with the discovery of a new group structure (Circle Group) and corresponding mathematical operations that finally made these computations feasible within the M31 field. This breakthrough is going to be used in Stwo prover by Starkware and integrated into Plonky3. Stwo is the replacement for Stone prover that Starknet used for the past 4 years. Going live in Q1/Q2 of next year, stwo includes few other improvements such as GKR lookups to reduce circuit size of the CairoVM (their zkVM – also the first one). zkVMs that use PLONKY3 will probably replace existing BabyBear with it, to take advantage of its efficiency. In terms of performance, Stwo is 125x faster than the current Stone prover from Starkware! This means faster and cheaper proofs for Starknet next year. They already clocked in 800+ TPS this year. Along with that, Stwo is able to compute 22,000 hashes per second on Consumer hardware. Recursion needs about 24,000 hashes to verify. This means it can do recursive proofs in under 3 seconds! Since this works so fast on 32 bit fields, this is going to be great, again for Client side proving. Using GPU acceleration, Stwo will be able to do more than a million hashes a second, which will be great for Ethereum (fast hashing is great for Ethereum) Kakarot zkEVM is bringing EVM compatibility to CairoVM, powered by the new Stwo prover that uses Circle Starks. This combination is powerful for two reasons: CairoVM’s naturally low cycle counts and the improved proof efficiency for proving per cycle. While Kakarot will first launch on Starknet, its plans extend beyond that – similar to existing zkVMs, it will be a prover for EVM blocks on rollups and EVM chains. This would be another important addition to the zkVM space, but with a key difference – instead of using hardware-based instruction sets like RiscV, it leverages CairoVM’s specialized architecture along with Circle Starks’ innovations in proof generation. JOLT JOLT looks at the problem of proving VMs differently. By using circuits for computations and their proof, there is an increase in inefficiency, because of its overhead. Lookups are already making the zkVMs efficient by reducing the VM circuit size and reduced number of columns. The first insight in JOLT is to look them up from a list of pre-computed table of inputs and their outputs – just like while multiplying, we often just remember instead of actually computing. For each instruction of CPU, we can map the inputs and the output in a table and all computations should be in somewhere in the table. But constructing these large tables and working with them becomes hard. And this is JOLT’s second insight, not to use the entire table. This is how a real program runs – it only uses a small fraction of all possible instruction input combinations. JOLT introduces a way to efficiently prove lookups into these massive theoretical tables without actually storing them, only “paying” for the entries you actually use during execution. This is huge because it means we can work directly with standard CPU instructions rather than translating everything into circuits. JOLT is building a zkVM based, and has released a RV32I (RISC-V 32-bit base integer) instruction set zkVM which is faster than current RiscV zkVMs. Looking forward JOLT will be combining Binius with their Sumcheck for improved performance. It doesn’t support recursion and continuations yet, and we should see improvement when these are integrated. JOLT is very early in its journey and there are a lot of optimizations that haven’t been done. Apart from Binius, Circle Stark, JOLT, there are number of improvements in proof systems like Sumcheck acceleration, Folding and many more. This is one of the fastest moving areas in the zk stack, and we’re expecting a lot of improvement across different areas. Sumcheck, Smaller fields, SNARK friendly hashes, and Lookups are emerging some as the way to go, and we’ll see more development in them. There is so much in the proof systems development next year, but some things that we can say Proof systems are the fastest moving layer of the stack, there are multiple variants in the pipeline for next year. These will mature and will be integrated, leading to big performance gains for the zkVMs There are 2 fundamental shifts – move towards small fields, move towards lookups, driving performance. These would be great for client side proof generation, which would be great for privacy applications. Proof systems are a competitive frontier: everyone seeks faster, cheaper proofs. If one system achieves a drastic, stable performance lead, it could become the de facto standard. Until then, multiple contenders will coexist, each vying for ecosystem adoption and tooling support. No More Excuses A few years ago the main excuse for why we didn’t have great applications was that the infra wasn’t ready. Fees were high, UX was bad and transactions were slow. Today, that’s no longer the case. With the numerous L1s/2s focused on performance, new stacks that enable better appchains, crypto primitives like FHE, TEEs and MPC, and the incredible advancements in ZK, the infra is here. It’s time to build some cool shit. Leave a commentshareCeteris + 3 others0 Comments Leave your comment... Cancel Reply Hmm it's quiet here.

Report Summary Summarize Report The report “Year Ahead for Markets – 2025” explores the state of the cryptocurrency markets, key themes driving market dynamics, and predictions for the future. Here are the key takeaways: 1. Crypto Market Overview: 2024 Highlights: Bitcoin’s rise to $100K+, driven by ETF inflows and renewed institutional interest, led to increased market optimism. However, this was juxtaposed with poor sentiment and underperformance in altcoins. Market Divergence: The year saw BTC dominance surge, but this failed to uplift the broader altcoin market. 2. Drivers of Crypto Markets: Institutional Adoption: Spot Bitcoin ETFs were a game-changer, signaling institutional confidence. The post-election regulatory shift promises a friendlier environment, unlocking potential for increased capital inflows. Liquidity Cycles: Crypto markets are highly sensitive to global liquidity conditions. The Fed’s pivot to rate cuts in late 2024 and supportive liquidity trends in China bode well for market growth in 2025. Stablecoin Growth: The stablecoin market, which contracted during high-rate environments, is expected to rebound, boosting onchain liquidity and activity. 3. Key Themes for 2025: Optimism Returns: Renewed trust in crypto markets as regulatory clarity improves. Rising stablecoin usage and institutional participation are likely to bring sustained growth. Memecoins and Fundamentals: The “memecoin supercycle” of 2024 highlights the speculative and narrative-driven nature of crypto. While memes thrive, the report anticipates a pivot back to fundamentally driven projects in 2025. Sectoral Shifts: Infrastructure and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects are poised to attract institutional interest. Emerging sectors like Real World Assets (RWA) and AI-driven decentralized applications could be key growth drivers. 4. Bitcoin and Broader Crypto Outlook: Bitcoin: Positioned as the cornerstone of crypto, BTC’s adoption as a macro asset is solidified. Its market cap (~$2 trillion) is small relative to traditional asset classes, signaling room for growth. Altcoins: Expect broader rallies beyond BTC as stablecoins and ETH drive liquidity into the system. 5. Solana’s Renaissance: Solana emerged as the ecosystem leader in 2024, driven by a strong developer community, innovative projects, and a focus on user experience. The chain’s rebound from past challenges showcases resilience, with notable traction in memecoins and new applications. Outlook: Solana is well-positioned to continue growing, challenging Ethereum in key areas like user experience and scalability. 6. Challenges and Considerations: Supply vs. Demand Imbalance: The sheer volume of new tokens has outpaced demand, requiring innovation to attract and retain users. Global Macro Risks: While liquidity trends are favorable, geopolitical and economic uncertainties could impact markets. Conclusion: The crypto markets are entering 2025 with a mix of optimism and challenges. Institutional participation, regulatory clarity, and emerging sectors are set to drive growth. Bitcoin remains the anchor, while altcoins and infrastructure projects are positioned for broader participation. Solana’s resurgence epitomizes the resilience and potential of blockchain ecosystems. The Year Ahead for Crypto 2025 – Full Series: AI+DePIN DeFi Gaming Infrastructure Markets Introduction — One Step At A Time, The Future Looks Bright We often overestimate what can happen in the short term, and underestimate what can happen in the long term. Most crypto participants thought crypto markets were going to rally to new all-time highs on the back of spot ETF products going live. After all, the institutions were finally coming to buy everyone’s bags and send crypto to the moon, right? Well, not exactly. At least not in the way many expected. In Q1, BTC rallied over 50% to $73K on the back of these shiny new ETFs launching. Billions of dollars flowed directly into the orange coin, and if there was any question around the institutional demand for BTC, it seemed as if those concerns were put to bed. The ETFs were an overwhelming success, even outshining the fading bullish macro tailwinds that had previously driven risk assets higher in late 2023 and early 2024. Eventually, these “heavyweight” macro drivers caught up with BTC and crypto markets, and for ~7 months the price mainly chopped and churned within the ~$60K – $70K range. Not great, but not too terrible. Unfortunately for the broader crypto market, the love was not equally distributed. Outside of small pockets of outperformance, most of the market struggled. The initial “failure” of spot ETH flows — or lack thereof — after their mid-year launch only compounded these struggles. Much of the story in 2024 was a tale of two markets, and subpar industry sentiment and infighting reflected this reality. Then everything changed again in November. While many viewed the Presidential election as divisive, it was anything but for the crypto industry. After years of regulation by litigation, the industry finally has something to look forward to — a much-needed reset and a fresh start under an administration that has so far promised fair, common-sense regulation. The hope is that now these promises are kept. The change in sentiment and risk appetite these last few weeks is palpable, so much so that we may begin to see this tale of two markets unify back into one. For those who’ve been following our Markets research for the last several years, some of these topics and themes will be familiar. We’ve discussed many of them in detail in some of our prior reports, which complement the commentary and analysis found in this piece. We’ve provided links to many of these throughout the report for those seeking additional context. The Cycle Playbook Is Right On Track At the end of 2022, we outlined our rationale for why the bottom of the bear market was behind us. Over 15 months ago, we began getting a lot more vocal about our conviction in this upcoming bull market cycle. In last year’s report, we predicted BTC would break to new ATHs by Q4 2024. While BTC technically broke to new highs in late March on the back of ETF hype, the most recent breakout is more in line with the one we’d been expecting. At the time, we were just over 3 months out from the next Bitcoin halving. We noted how BTC tends to rally in the weeks leading up to the event — and how price typically consolidates post-event, setting up an even bigger move later on. Fast forward and that’s essentially what happened. The explosive move has put us right in the sweet spot — with more room to run. We also reiterated that Bitcoin halvings weren’t the key catalyst for bull cycles in our view — they just happen to coincide with opportune moments in BTC’s cyclical history. As a reminder, this was then… And this is now… It’s almost miraculous how closely BTC has tracked our cycle playbook. Longtime readers of our research know why this is the case — no miracles necessary — and why this has been our expectation all along. Markets are momentum-driven, and nowhere is that more evident than BTC and crypto. Each new all-time high for BTC has coincided with a monthly RSI breakout > 70. Prior bull markets didn’t run out of steam until this indicator broke above 90. Hypothetically, if this heuristic were to hold, BTC would have to hit ~$175,000 — or even $190,000-$200,000 if it really starts to run — before these RSI levels were reached. This assumes the current cycle top is marked by a swift period of accelerated gains, like most prior cycles. BTC is also well below the 1-2 standard deviation moves that often signal cyclical tops. It’s hard to see the forest through the trees in an industry that moves as fast as this one. As we all know far too well, volatility cuts both ways — which is why time horizons matter. In case you need more proof of this, here’s a fun fact. Even if you managed to top tick BTC in November 2021, you’d still be outperforming every other major asset class over that period, if you managed to hold on. Bitcoin breaking to new all-time highs is more than just a catchy headline too — it’s the ultimate risk-on driver for crypto markets. “Price is the ultimate driver of attention, capital flows, and onchain activity.” Retail didn’t show up en masse last cycle until BTC’s price made a decisive break above its prior ATH. This pattern is evident in everything from Google search trends and the surge in “Bitcoin” news articles to the growth in Coinbase’s consumer transaction revenue. Investor confidence and risk appetite tend to rise when BTC gives the ‘all clear’, smashing previous ATHs. Price drives attention — which also turbocharges FOMO and capital inflows. Look no further than the trend in BTC ETF flows this year. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has seen the 3rd largest inflows this year across all ETFs — the only ones beating it are the two largest S&P 500 ETFs, which have a combined AUM that’s ~20x the size of IBIT (~$1.1 trillion). Price is the ultimate driver, and for the second year in a row BTC finds itself atop the leaderboard when compared to traditional asset classes. BTC has not only broken out to a new price high — it’s also breaking out against the NDX, which is up nearly 30% itself YTD. BTC has also broken out against the SPX…which is on track for one of its best years in the past three decades. It’s also broken to new highs against its “boomer” shiny counterpart — gold. We’ve said for a long time that one day the stigma around BTC would be flipped on its head — that one day not having exposure to BTC would become the bigger risk for investors and institutions. In our view, that day is here. HAHAHAHA I AM DYING 😭😭😭@JoeSquawk dunking on Tradfi Bitcoin skeptic : “You missed it” 💀 pic.twitter.com/VvlPO3TLA4 — Mason (@MasonFoard) December 5, 2024 Poking fun at bitcoin is no longer the “cool” thing to do anymore. This is the cycle that solidifies BTC as a macro asset that can no longer be ignored. Bitcoin’s market cap is now ~$2 trillion. Two Trillion American Minted United States Dollars. That’s big. If it was a publicly traded company, BTC would be the 6th most valuable in the world. It wasn’t too long ago that many saw $100K BTC as little more than a pipe dream. Now the timeline is flooded with this type of energy. At $91,150 Bitcoin flips Saudi Aramco At $109,650 Bitcoin flips Amazon At $107,280 Bitcoin flips Google At $156,700 Bitcoin flips Microsoft At $170,900 Bitcoin flips Apple At $179,680 Bitcoin flips NVIDEA pic.twitter.com/6Ls81CRVbK — Creeper (@DegenCreeper) November 12, 2024 Bitcoin is now big enough to command the attention it deserves. But it’s not so big that it doesn’t have plenty of room to still grow. At the time of writing… BTC’s market cap is still only 11% of the combined market cap of the MAG7 (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA). It’s less than 3% of total US public equity market cap, and ~1.5% globally. BTC’s entire market value is still only 5% of total US public debt outstanding — and less than 0.7% of total global debt (public + private). There’s 3x more money held in US money market funds compared to BTC’s market cap. BTC’s market value is still only equivalent to ~15% of total global foreign reserve assets. Hypothetically, if global central banks reallocated 5% of their gold reserves to BTC, that would net over $150 billion in additional buying power — or 3x the total net flows into IBIT this year. Household net worth is at an all-time high (>$160 trillion) — over $40 trillion higher than its pre-COVID peak — largely driven by rising housing prices and a roaring stock market. For those keeping score at home, that’s 80x higher than BTC’s current market cap. The point is there’s still plenty of deep capital pools for BTC and crypto markets to draw from. All of this serves as potential demand when people gain confidence that the crypto market is heading higher. In a world where the Fed — and other central banks — are driving 5-7% annual debasement of their currencies, investors need to make more like 10-15% annual returns to outpace this loss in future purchasing power. That is why investor attention is increasingly shifting towards higher growth industries — it’s the best place to seek out above-average returns. We believe investors will continue being rewarded for owning risk as the tailwinds stacking up continue to outweigh the potential headwinds. Global Liquidity → Currency Debasement Marches On On the macro front, reality has been falling in line with expectations. By now, we know Bitcoin halvings aren’t the primary catalyst for crypto market cycles, it’s all about liquidity cycles. Fluctuations in global liquidity drive fluctuations in global markets — stocks, bonds, currencies, gold, bitcoin — they’re all impacted to varying degrees. We’ve spilled a ton of ink talking about liquidity over the years, so we won’t regurgitate all the reasons why it’s so important to understand. For those interested, a few recent reports discussing this dynamic include High off the Halving, and The Dark Night Rises. Bitcoin is the most sensitive to these fluctuations as its core value proposition is ultimately the purest expression of it — the most pure hedge on global currency debasement. This is precisely why BTC exhibits such high sensitivity to changes in global liquidity and monetary growth. At the end of last year, we laid out the favorable conditions working in BTC’s favor for a strong Q1 — one of which was the surge in global liquidity we saw starting in Q4 2023. We also warned there was a higher risk of a market pullback starting around late Q1 to early Q2 2024. The reason? We saw signs of liquidity momentum fading, specifically from the world’s two most important central banks. BTC is up over 130% year-to-date — and it’s done so without much support from the Fed. In fact, Fed liquidity has been steadily falling for the last 9-10 months. As we’ve noted, Fed liquidity essentially tracks changes in bank reserves. (Note: some calculations of Fed liquidity include currency in circulation, but either way the conclusion remains the same). From mid-2023 through March 2024, Fed liquidity grew by nearly $400B. Despite the $700B+ increase in the TGA over that period, we also saw a whopping ~$1.5T drawdown in the RRP, which more than offset and helped boost bank reserves by ~$400B. Since then, the Fed’s balance sheet reduction has outpaced further declines in the RRP, helping push bank reserves — and thus Fed liquidity — lower. We noted back in July how the TGA had grown by over $700B since mid-2023 — and how some of that could get drawn down ahead of the US presidential election. That hasn’t happened yet — the TGA still has $750B in it. But we expect this drawdown will happen soon. On January 1st, the US debt ceiling will be reinstated (based on the amount of debt outstanding on that date). Until legislation is passed to raise or suspend the debt ceiling (yet again), the US Treasury will have to tap cash on hand in the TGA to finance its spending obligations. We’ve seen this song and dance before too (key debt ceiling dates highlighted in below chart). The US debt ceiling will need to be raised again — it’s not a question of “if”, but “when”. The US continues to run multi-trillion dollar deficits, which only adds to its growing mountain of public debt. Despite all the recent rhetoric around cutting the fiscal deficit, the gap between total government spending and revenues is not one that’ll be solved in a couple quarters. Earlier this year, we highlighted how mandatory spending programs and interest expenses on US public debt are larger than the total amount of annual revenue that the USG collects. Again, this doesn’t even include discretionary spending. We also highlighted how big US interest expenses could get depending on where US rates wind up. The USG’s interest bill on its swelling $34 trillion public debt is already ~$1 trillion per year alone. For context, that’s equivalent to ~4% of US GDP and ~20% of the USG’s total revenue in FY 2024. The Fed makes a concerted effort to keep its distance from commenting on fiscal policy, but what the Fed does from here will have a direct impact on this growing segment of US gov’t spending. Meanwhile, the US Treasury has to rollover nearly $10 trillion of debt over the next 12 months. That’s over 30% of annual GDP. At the end of the day, continued fiscal deficits will increase US public debts, which requires more liquidity, more monetization and more currency debasement. Which is good news for holders of scarce assets (equities, RE, gold, BTC, crypto). When it comes to global central bank liquidity over this past year, the PBOC has done most of the heavy lifting — especially in the back half of the year. This is another trend we’ve talked ad nauseam about. The bottom line is that the PBOC is one of the two most influential central banks when it comes to global liquidity — and therefore global markets. What happens in China matters. It has always mattered. PBOC liquidity played a role in the 2020/21 crypto bull market, the 2022 bear market, the late 2022/early 2023 recovery from cycle lows, the surge in Q4 2023 (ahead of BTC ETF approvals), and the Q2-Q3 pullback earlier this year. PBOC liquidity even turned positive again a few months ahead of the 2024 US Presidential election. Changes in PBOC liquidity often precede large volatile moves in BTC and crypto markets. Last year, we reminded readers that risk assets had one of their best years in 2017 despite consistent Fed rate hikes and QT expectations. “During this time, the PBOC’s balance sheet was also expanding, and coupled with a weaker USD, helped give risk assets the liquidity boost they needed.” This is similar to what we’ve seen play out for much of this year — China has been the bigger driver of central bank liquidity. We’ve previously discussed some of the reasons why PBOC liquidity should continue to expand in 2025 — and the impact that it can have on global markets, BTC, and the spillover effects on global growth. In last year’s report, we noted the PBOC’s balance sheet expansion and the additional boost that could give US equities. The SPX is up nearly 30% this year. We’ve also noted how closely it tracks changes in the US business cycle. To be fair, the recovery in the US ISM has been more muted than we had expected so far. But several indicators imply it will start to trend higher into expansionary territory in 2025 amidst a supportive liquidity backdrop. This is more good news for stocks… And more good news for BTC. We’ve talked about some of the similarities between the current setup and the setup we found ourselves in during the 2017 cycle too. But unlike 2016-2017, the Fed is in the early stages of cutting rates — not hiking them. There’s now over $6 trillion sitting in money market funds too, some of which will flow out in search of higher returns. We’ve seen this happen during previous rate cutting cycles. And this isn’t just a US-centric trend either. The ECB, for example, is projecting a more dovish path forward as the Eurozone faces genuine stagflation concerns. Many Eurozone countries are likely to continue running mid-to-high single digit deficits as a % of GDP. Even as several of the largest EU countries are already running considerably high debt-to-GDP ratios. That’s not to say global policymakers are back in full blown easing mode — we’re not going to see the size and swiftness of monetary and fiscal stimulus we saw back in 2020-2021. But the trend towards easing over tightening helps support markets, and an already resilient US economy. It’s not perfect — there’s plenty of people still struggling with higher consumer prices, and lower income households are facing wallet pressures. But we’re not staring down the barrel of a deep imminent US recession, which historically has been the one big consistent headwind to risk markets. Our view is we’re still in the midst of an upward liquidity cycle. Lower interest rates and sustained economic growth should support favorable credit conditions. Expansions and contractions in private credit growth also increase or decrease the amount of money sloshing around global capital markets. Which again benefits BTC. China has a big influence here given the size of its private credit market, which has grown 3x faster than the US over the last 10 years. Global private credit growth has a strong correlation with Global M2 growth. We believe Global M2 growth will continue to make new highs next year (even if the ride is a bit bumpy). Remember, Global M2 is still coming off one of its worst contractions on record. “Global M2 grew at an average annual rate of ~5% in the prior decade pre-COVID. If its growth rate were to revert back to just 3% per year, that’d equate to a $7-10 trillion rise in Global M2 over the next 2-3 years — which would certainly bode well for for risk assets, with BTC and the broader crypto market at the forefront.” — Dark Night Rises If the outlook for macroeconomic conditions is generally favorable as we wade into 2025, where do crypto markets head from here? Key Theme: Optimism Returns 2024 was a weird year for crypto markets. On one hand, most of the majors recovered to ATHs, and the broader alt complex staged an impressive recovery. But Crypto Twitter also spent most of the year infighting and coping. Obviously, CT is always a neurotic mess, but this year’s poor sentiment stands out as it drew such a sharp contrast to the otherwise positive price action. Blast szn – RUGGED Base szn – RUGGED FTM szn – RUGGED Aptos april – RUGGED Tia and Dym Airdrop szn – RUGGED ETHBTC – RUGGED Wormhole – RUGGED I’m starting to think you guys are all frauds when it comes to anything that’s not a micro cap or a dog coin on solana — ً (@SilvXBT) April 29, 2024 What explains this dichotomy? Well, several things. The first is Bitcoin dominance. BTC had a monster year driven by ETF flows and Trump. These trends drove its price up over 130% YTD and pushed its dominance to a three-year high. Rising dominance intuitively means that Bitcoin outperformed most other cryptoassets. And since CT is wildly underweight the orange coin, most crypto natives did not benefit from this BTC-led market regime. The second driver of poor sentiment was dispersion. This is just a fancy way to say that a few coins went up A LOT, some went up a little, and most actually went down or were flat. As the chart below illustrates, there were small pockets of extreme outperformance but also whole lotta red, which is notable on a year that Bitcoin pumped north of 100%. *@ceterispar1bus — YTD Performance thru December 5th* The dispersion we saw this year was new for crypto markets. In past cycles, everything traded together. When BTC pumped +1%, ETH usually jumped +2%, Alts +3%, and so on. But this cycle was different. The rising Bitcoin tide did not lift all ships. And the classic ‘Path to Altseason’ that so many people grew accustomed to failed to materialize. However, one sector did pump — memecoins. As a result, this cycle has been dubbed the ‘Memecoin Supercycle’ — a prognosis we support. Memes were by far the best-performing sector in 2024. They first exploded onto the scene in Q1, catching many people offsides. They contributed to the unexpected rise of the barbell portfolio — majors and memes — which drove widespread underperformance and led to a stupendous amount of cope through the first half of the year. I put $1k into this coin 20 days ago pic.twitter.com/Rb8J33j1EC — blockgraze (@blockgraze) December 13, 2023 Memecoins are the third and final reason for poor sentiment this year. Our thinking here is twofold. First, no one likes to watch other people get rich while their bags go sideways. And second, memecoins contributed to the sense that crypto is just one big ponzi. We wrote about this at length in our Attention Is All You Need report. But at a high level, memecoins triggered some existential angst and soul-searching within our space. do fundamentals matter? is everything a meme? is crypto just a casino on mars? in the collective public imagination, crypto oscillates between the future technologically unified global financial system and the largest scam in human history how can the narrative seemingly alternate between these two extremes, and do it every 2 years? — olaf (@zxocw) September 12, 2022 As Olaf eloquently puts it, crypto gyrates between ‘it’s all ponzi’ and ‘this tech is going to change the world.’ The former dominated the discourse in 2024, but we believe 2025 will bring a shift towards the latter. In other words, optimism will return to crypto markets. We think two major trends will drive this shift: structural inflows futuristic narratives The first driver comes down to supply and demand. In 2024, the new money that flowed into crypto was narrowly focused. Although BTC received historic inflows, most of the wealth creation didn’t trickle down into the broader altcoin complex. We expect this to change in 2025 thanks to stablecoin and ETH ETF inflows — both of which are inflecting up right now. Stablecoin inflows will boost liquidity in the system, while a rising ETH price is good for the long tail of tech alts and fundamental tokens since ETH is one of the most widely held assets in crypto. When ETH pumps, it creates leverage in the system as traders borrow against their ETH bags to buy other tokens. People also generally just feel more wealthy, which increases risk appetite and bullish sentiment. This year, a narrative has emerged that “ETH pumps are bearish.” While we find this hilarious, we believe 2025 will flip the script and Make ETH Pumps Great Again. We will miss the memes, though… $ETH rallies over the weekend and the whole market dies. Classic🥲 pic.twitter.com/3HrBjikrct — Mercury (@TraderMercury) April 29, 2024 The second driver of a return to optimism is crypto markets learning to dream again. This one is more psychological than structural. When everyone believes the market is PvP, then the market indeed is PvP. But when everyone believes the market is PvE, then, well, you get the idea. These narratives are reflexive. In 2024, we saw a mix of PvP and PvE dynamics, but for most of the year, it was PvP. This is markedly different from the last cycle, which featured an Everything Pump. Back then, we also had the birth of entirely new sectors — L1s, DeFi, GameFi, and many others. But this year, it’s been almost all memes. I often wonder if I’m in the wrong industry. Take SpaceX for example. They send a rocket to Mars? Humanity advances. They fail to send one and blow it up? Humanity learns a lesson and advances. All outcomes lead to progress. In contrast, crypto is a damn casino for dum-dums… — Péter Szilágyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) August 5, 2024 Don’t get us wrong, we love memecoins, but they present an inherently less optimistic worldview than tech alts that aspire to change the world. Last cycle, we had many different flavors of world-changing ideas. But this cycle has felt less ambitious. We expect this to change in 2025 as a renewed sense of optimism takes hold across our industry. People will start to believe in crypto again. It will no longer just be “all memes.” The catalysts for this psychological switch-up may be hard to see today, but in hindsight, they will be obvious: Trump winning Truth Terminal Bitcoin $100K We believe that by the end of next year, we will look back on these three events as the time when optimism finally returned to crypto. https://storage.googleapis.com/members-portal-bucket/uploads/2024/12/b1bf075e-document_5183697201792025564.mp4 Key Theme: The Missing Ingredients – Stablecoin Growth & Credit Creation At their most fundamental level, markets are a function of supply and demand. When demand outpaces supply, prices generally rise. When supply outpaces demand, prices generally decline. This is as close to a ‘law of physics’ as we can observe in markets. As we’ve alluded to in many of our reports over the past year, crypto markets have been facing a massive supply-demand imbalance. Simply put, overall crypto demand has not kept pace with overall crypto supply. But why? Token Supply Is Too Damn High The easiest way to observe supply-side dynamics is by looking at overall token numbers. Token supply can come from both from private markets and public market places. When we look at coin aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, the token lists are over 100 pages long with over 10,000 tokens to choose from. This is in stark contrast to the 1000-1500 tokens making up these same lists in 2017, representing a nearly 10x+ increase in the number of tokens. The crazy thing? These aggregators don’t even tell the whole story when it comes to public market token supply. Far from it. With the rise of applications like pump.fun on Solana, token creation has never been easier. Since January 2024, more than 4 million tokens have been launched on pump.fun, with over 50,000 graduating beyond the bonding curve onto Solana’s Raydium. These numbers are simply mind boggling. It’s so easy to launch pump.fun tokens that people now do it from within video games like Minecraft… And these numbers don’t even account for increasing token supply resulting from private market investments. After ICOs received the ban hammer many years ago, private funding has taken the baton, becoming the primary way for early stage crypto projects to secure financing. Since the 2017 cycle, we’ve seen the amount of private capital raised (and deployed), increase significantly. In Q2 2022, crypto VCs raised $16 billion, earmarked for early stage private investment. This results in even more supply entering the market — after all, funds and LPs need a return on their investments. Many of these 2021 and 2022 vintages are finally making their way into public markets. Today, the market faces the highest levels of new token supply ever. The demand side of the equation tells a different story. Total crypto market cap is the easiest way of visualizing overall demand, and the trend has been clear: In the 2017 cycle, the total crypto market cap grew from ~$40B to ~$750B, an 18x. Last cycle in 2020, the market grew from ~$280B to ~$2.8T, a 10x. So far this cycle, the market has grown from a base of ~$1T to about $3.3T, just over a 3x. This was largely due to BTC outperformance — a direct result of ETF induced institutional demand — and the ‘Trump Bump’ starting in November. For the majority of 2024, the total crypto market cap had been hovering underneath the $2.5T mark, below prior cycle highs. This illustrates a clear lack of new demand entering the industry outside of BTC focused demand. But total crypto market cap doesn’t tell the whole demand story. In a more granular sense, the crypto market can be thought of as BTC, and everything else known as crypto ex-BTC. As previously mentioned, BTC demand increased substantially this past year with the launch of BTC ETFs bringing an air of institutional acceptance into the space. This demand has been reflected in ETF flows as well as in BTC price action. The maturation and acceptance of BTC has not come with the same acceptance for the entire universe of crypto assets, leading to increased industry segmentation. We have not seen the demand for crypto ex-BTC assets keep pace with BTC-focused demand. This is glaringly apparent in metrics like TOTAL2 and TOTAL3, which were well below prior cycle levels until this past November. The TLDR? There is simply too many tokens and not enough demand for these tokens outside of BTC. The Missing Ingredients The current cycle has had two missing ingredients that help to explain much of the aforementioned supply/demand conundrum — stablecoin growth & credit expansion. In the past, crypto markets were once more closely tied to BTC price action. This is because BTC was the main trading pair for altcoins, and the main collateral used within our speculative markets. In order to trade altcoins, you needed to buy BTC first. This was the process flow in the early days on exchanges like BitMEX or Poloniex. As with anything, times change. Over the last several years, crypto participants have moved towards stablecoin denominated trading pairs. Stablecoins are now the preferred base asset for speculation within the crypto markets. And stablecoins are very sensitive to interest rates. Coincidentally, the current market cycle is the first cycle in which interest rates began at elevated levels. Elevated interest rates weigh heavily on stablecoin driven demand dynamics. High interest rates increase the hurdle rate for investors. If an investor can clip 4%-5% in risk free markets, they are less likely to take on more speculative positioning, and less likely to move capital on-chain via stablecoins. A quick look at the numbers shows just how sensitive stablecoins are to interest rates: In March 2020, the Fed cut rates to near zero and the stablecoin market cap was ~$5B. By the time the Fed started hiking rates in March 2022, stablecoin market cap had grown to over $130B (~25x). During the Fed’s rate hike cycle (March 2022-July 2023), stablecoin market cap fell by over $20B. Additionally, elevated interest rates weigh on credit creation. When conditions are more conducive (lower interest rates), economic growth, increased consumer spending and asset price increases are easier to achieve. These are the conditions in which prior crypto market cycles thrived. Just a few years ago, crypto lending markets (and crypto market prices) peaked amidst a backdrop of this low interest rate environment as it fueled an insatiable bout of risk appetite. For context, Genesis’ loan book had $130B in originations, and nearly $13B in active loans at the end of 2021. These numbers don’t even include other key lenders like BlockFi, Celsius, and Voyager. Much of this credit made its way back into the crypto ecosystem, acting as a key source of demand for crypto assets, propelling prices to astonishing levels. Since Powell pumped the breaks in 2022, hiking interest rates at an unprecedented pace to combat soaring inflation, stablecoin growth and crypto credit creation have suffered tremendously. Many of the centralized lending institutions that helped propel crypto markets to new heights no longer exist. Two of the key catalysts of last cycle’s ‘everything rally’ have been entirely hamstrung. However, we’ve finally reached the turning point — Powell’s Pivot. In September 2024, the FOMC cut interest rates by 75bps, with several additional rate cuts expected over the next 12 months. As we know, lower interest rates reduce the hurdle rate for investors, and should incentivize more speculative behavior. In crypto markets, this manifests itself in the form of stablecoin growth and increased credit creation. Additionally (and perhaps more importantly), the US Presidential Election has provided crypto markets with the assurances of a significantly less-harsh regulatory environment. Markets hate uncertainty, and the results from this year’s Presidential race relieved some of the uncertainty weighing on the crypto industry at large. The combination of these two developments bodes extremely well for stablecoin growth, crypto credit creation — and by extension — crypto markets. Lower interest rates combined with a more friendly and transparent regulatory environment have the potential to unleash the demand needed to finally counteract the supply-side imbalances that have been stifling crypto markets. While it is unlikely we see credit creation reach the levels we saw several years ago, we do not believe it is as necessary for crypto markets to soar — we think that will largely come from stablecoin growth. Since the election, overall stablecoin market cap has grown by nearly 15%, or $20B. We believe this trend will continue well into 2025, with stablecoin market caps continuing to move up and to the right, eventually topping out above the $200B-$250B range — ushering in a reversal in fortunes for the broader crypto market. So, which crypto sectors and assets are primed to be outsized beneficiaries of this trend? Key Theme: Meme Continuation, Pivot to Fundamentals… or Both? 2024 gave rise to the Major-Memecoin barbell portfolio. We wrote about these dynamics extensively in The Dog Days of Summer and Attention Is All You Need deep dive reports. Are these market dynamics set to stay the same and are we in for another year of memecoin dominance? Or have crypto markets finally turned the corner and are we returning to a reality driven by fundamentals? As with most things, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. Turning The Corner First and foremost, we noted the waves of change splashing over crypto markets in the “Optimism Returns” section of this report. For the first time in years, the future outlook for our industry is particularly exciting, and even those outside of the most devout crypto market participants are starting to take notice. Markets are forward looking, and when the future is bleak with despair, industries and assets suffer. When the future is bright with hope, industries and assets flourish. Crypto markets have begun moving out of the darkness and into the light. We’ve seen BTC rip to above $100K. We’ve seen crypto related equities like Coinbase and even Robinhood go on substantial rallies and expand their product suites. We’ve even seen traditional equities like TSLA rally significantly as well. All of this, in our view, can be attributed to the harsh regulatory regime discount finally being closed as we move into the new four year term under the incoming Trump administration. If campaign promises are to be believed, the days of regulation by litigation for the crypto industry are likely behind us, and clear rules and regulation are finally within arm’s reach. The industry will finally be governed fairly, and not by those who wish to see it destroyed. Prior to the November election, outperformance was extremely segmented. Majors and Memes performed extremely well, while fundamental coins, such as those within the ETH/DeFi sectors, languished. Delphi Scope Since the election, the outlook could not be more different. We no longer see an extremely segmented industry, but an industry moving in tandem. This is epitomized by the strong bid return to the fundamental-esq sectors that had previously been left behind for the prior 10 months. Up and to the right, as they say. Delphi Scope We have consistently written about how one of the best signals of future outperformance is to monitoring which assets perform best out of key inflection moments. This past November is one of those moments and the signal is clear. The Institutions Are Coming (Real) Until this past year, institutional capital has been extremely hesitant to touch anything crypto related. The threat of regulatory uncertainty was far too great. This began to change, with the begrudging SEC approval of spot BTC ETFs, laying the ground work for future institutional investment. The removal of a hostile regulatory regime, replaced with one that promises to regulate fairly and provide clear rules, opens the industry up to even greater capital investment. It is no longer seen as a career risk to invest in this burgeoning industry, but rather a career risk to avoid it. If it’s good enough for BlackRock ETFs (and perhaps the US Government with talks of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve), it’s good enough for institutional investors. These institutional investors are going to look for investment opportunities that feel familiar. While some of these players may dabble in memecoins, they are much more likely to be interested by assets in sectors like ETH/SOL DeFi or Infrastructure versus a dog wif a hat. Look no further than the contrast in ETH ETF flows pre- and post-election, signaling a clear shift in institutional demand for crypto assets outside of BTC. Institutions will look towards assets that generate fees or yield, and can be modeled in a somewhat similar vein to what they are familiar with in the traditional finance world. We believe this is what the ‘sophisticated, institutional’ class of investor will most likely gravitate towards the most. After all, familiarity can lead to a sense of comfortability. Markets are waking up to this realization, which can be seen with the recent rallies in the aforementioned sectors. As traditional money managers make their foray into crypto, big money will be made by those who can front run their flows and investment picks. So while the last 12 months has been captured by the Major/Memecoin barbell portfolio, we think the year ahead will be characterized by something more reminiscent of the ‘everything rally’ from prior cycles —with a renewed vigor and emphasis placed on fundamentally driven projects. These may be assets like OG DeFi, both with an emphasis on proven track record and battle-tested. They may be in infrastructure assets, akin to the L1 trade we’ve seen in the past. They may be RWAs or even newer sectors like AI or DePin. This doesn’t mean we will see every single coin go on to rally triple digits like we saw last cycle, and this does not mean the end of memecoins — memes are definitely here to stay. What this likely means is a new beginning and the start of a more broad-based crypto rally, fueled by a rising tide that lifts all ships. Key Theme: Solana Accelerates 2024 was a big year for Solana. Two years removed, and the ecosystem is almost unrecognizable from the FTX lows. But despite all the change, the outlook for SOL remains similar to this time last year. Solana is ascendant, Ethereum is in disarray, and no other L1 looks quite ready to break the duopoly. Of course, much has transpired over the past twelve months, as we will soon discuss, but it’s striking how much of our original Solana thesis in the 2024 Markets Year Ahead report still holds. At the time, we wrote that all the lower-level data pointed in Solana’s favor; the EVM ecosystem was fragmented and hard to allocate to; and Solana had more narrative ‘shots on goal.’ Fast forward to today, and all these things still ring true. But regurgitating the same talking points would make for a rather boring report. So, instead, let’s recap some history and re-underwrite our Solana thesis with fresh eyes. A few months before two coffee and a beer. Spooky pic.twitter.com/uDBK5Qyd38 — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) March 1, 2022 Out Of The Ashes Rises The Phoenix Solana was the soaring Phoenix of last cycle. At the start of 2021, SOL was trading under $2, and the chain was still relatively obscure. But that all changed the day SBF started bullposting and threw the full force of FTX behind the fledgling L1. SBF was responsible for birthing Serum, one of the more innovative DeFi primitives at the time. And he also pumped hundreds of millions into the ecosystem via venture dollars. I’ll buy as much SOL has you have, right now, at $3. Sell me all you want. Then go fuck off. — SBF (@SBF_FTX) January 9, 2021 SOL ran from $1 to $260 — in one year (!) — amid the broader “Alt L1 trade” and thanks to its “Sam coin” status. The ecosystem was still nascent, but all the hype helped onboard teams like Jito, Drift, and Helium — all of which would go on to become foundational pieces of the network. Ultimately, Solana flew too close to the sun. And in 2022, the Phoenix met its inevitable demise. Solana was consumed in flames and reduced to ash. This was triggered by the massive fraud at FTX, the broader bear market, and questions over the chain’s stability. From pico top to pico bottom, SOL drew down -96%. It was the kind of drawdown that kills most startups. And it nearly did Solana in. Over the course of 2022, capital fled, projects shuttered, and retail disappeared. It was a dark time for crypto markets, but particularly Solana. Many left the chain for dead. Ethereum and even Cosmos were seen as safer bets at the time. It didn’t help that several high-profile Solana teams pivoted to Ethereum near the stone bottom, reinforcing this narrative. CoinDesk But then something weird happened. A memecoin called ‘Bonk’ airdropped 50% of its supply to the Solana community on Christmas Day 2022. SOL was trading around $11 at the time, and there weren’t many reasons for optimism. But Bonk was the start of something bigger. It rallied the few remaining devs and provided an injection of hope. One day people will realize what Bonk did for Solana – Created at the stone cold bottom of the bear market around $10 SOL – Jumpstarts Solana’s DeFi ecosystem – Sells out the Solana Saga phone – Provides the foundation for WIF, MYRO and many others creating a memecoin culture — Solana Legend 🎒 (@SolanaLegend) June 9, 2024 SOL put in its bottom at $8 a few days later on December 29th, capping a soul-crushing year for the chain. Amid the pain of 2022, not even the most delusional manlets could have predicted what 2023 would bring. Decrypt From the ashes, a faint glow emerged in 2023 — the Phoenix began its slow and painful rebirth. It was a year of rebuilding for Solana. The dozen or so teams that stuck around through the bear market used the pain of 2022 to grind harder. There weren’t many users back then, but that didn’t matter. Teams like Drift, Jito, and Tensor iterated relentlessly for the core power users that remained. If we had to pinpoint a singular inflection point for Solana’s revival, it would be the hackathons. At the time, they were criticized for being “centralized.” But in hindsight, they were a GTM masterclass. They brought new devs into the ecosystem and, more broadly, injected some sorely needed momentum into the community. The builder energy they inspired ultimately culminated in Solana winning several big BD battles — Helium, Shopify, and Visa. If 2023 started with a glow, it ended with a flame. It was the Jito airdrop on December 7, 2023, that provided the spark. Jito was one of the few teams that doubled down on Solana in the middle of the bear market and by the end of 2023, they had built some critical infra for the chain. The Jito airdrop will likely go down as one of the greatest wealth-creation events in crypto history. If you held just $1 of JitoSOL, you would have received ~$10,000 worth of JTO. But many people received much more. It was life-changing money that quite literally changed the trajectory of the chain. The airdrop also shocked the broader crypto space, which had largely written Solana off. As a result, the airdrop ignited a wave of fomo flows. The JTO airdrop was also perfectly timed. The only people on Solana at the time were the true believers — the couple hundred manlets who refused to capitulate. This meant Jito was able to get tokens into the hands of Solana OGs and sidestep mercenary farmers. The airdrop was a UNI-style moment for the Solana faithful and minted many millionaires. It will probably never again be replicated on Solana. But there’s a chance it might on another downbad chain in the future. Midjourney In 2024, the Phoenix was reborn. Solana emerged from the ashes stronger and more powerful than ever. The momentum from the Jito airdrop carried over into the new year as more teams started to airdrop. This created an even larger onchain wealth effect, which led to more activity, more inflows, and more attention. But not everyone was convinced. Many people dismissed it as “all airdrops.” But this proved short-sighted as just a few weeks later, a string of memecoins electrified crypto markets with their rapid ascents. Nevertheless, the doubters dug in and moved on to calling Solana “all memecoins.” The narrative at the time was memecoins were less innovative than past speculative waves like food farms during Ethereum’s DeFi summer. While this argument made sense on some level — looping across farms is slightly more sophisticated than aping random shitters on Pump.fun — it falls flat because the only thing that really matters is people using the chain. We must be careful not to judge how people use these chains. After all, we are investors, not priests. And from an investment perspective, usage is usage, regardless of its form. Usage creates a virtuous cycle of speculation → building → more speculation → and more building. This is how Ethereum built its DeFi ecosystem last cycle. And Solana has run the same playbook this year, except with memecoins, not food farms. More broadly, Solana has dominated just about every new meta this year. First, it was airdrops. Then memes. And most recently, it’s been AI agents, err, ‘sentient memes.’ But above all else, memes have been the trend of the year. And they have dominated trading volumes across the space. Notably, most of this activity has happened on Solana. In the first half of the year, most of this activity was driven by ‘pure memes’ like WIF and BODEN. But ever since Truth Terminal, the meta has shifted to AI. Now, most of the hot new tokens are a quixotic AI x memecoin blend. Kaito.AI Narrative Heatmap (2024) Even if we think all of these metas — airdrops, PolitiFi, memecoins, AI agents, etc — are over-hyped and short-lived, it’s hard to ignore that they were all started on Solana. Yes, Ethereum mainnet has some popular memecoins. And yes, Base has seen notable AI activity. But all of the biggest trends this year have started — and been dominated — on Solana. It’s an incredible turn of events for an ecosystem that, just a few years ago, many had left for dead. One of the best things in life you can be is hard to kill pic.twitter.com/7NSdlq6Qme — prayingforexits 🏴‍☠️ (@mrexits) November 5, 2024 Solana’s 2025 Outlook Solana experienced a renaissance in 2024. The chain went from “dead” to birthing all of the major metas in just a year. The rate of growth is staggering and even more impressive when you consider how young the chain is. an overlooked fact about Solana is that it’s the youngest chain/asset in the top 10 we’ve grown this much while having the least amount of time the cooking will continue — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) December 7, 2024 But as we head into 2025, questions linger: Is the SOL repricing over? Will memecoin activity fade? Will Base steal market share? What about all the other high-performance chains? Will Ethereum finally wake up and fight back? While these concerns are all valid, we believe Solana is just getting started. Competition is brewing, but we are skeptical that Ethereum will pivot fast enough or that all the new high-performance chains like Monad or Sui will be able to steal meaningful market share. In short, we remain extremely bullish on SOL — both on a relative and absolute basis vs assets like ETH. Our SOL 2025 thesis boils down to two core beliefs: Solana’s lower-level data is a leading indicator of a SOLETH repricing Solana’s leadership, culture, and ecosystem are unrivaled across crypto Let’s dive in. Midjourney Women Lie, Men Lie, Numbers Don’t Lie This time last year, we noted that Solana was at parity with Ethereum across several lower-level data points like DEX and stablecoin volume. This was our chart from the Markets Year Ahead 2024 report. At the time, it seemed obvious to us that activity on Solana would continue to outpace Ethereum. We believed Solana would move from parity to beating it handily across most metrics. And that’s exactly what happened. However, our crystal ball was not perfect. We also predicted that higher-level figures — like TVL and market cap — would lag but eventually close the gap with Ethereum. At the time, we called for 0.1 SOLETH by the end of 2024, which proved to be overly optimistic… Although we were not surprised by Solana’s growth, we were surprised that its TVL and relative value vs. ETH lagged so far behind most other metrics. If you look at the top row of charts below, you will see that Solana is beating Ethereum by sizeable margins across almost every low-level metric. We have been particularly impressed by the growth in Solana’s Real Economic Value (REV). In our view, REV is the best way to measure demand for blockspace. It includes transaction fees and MEV, giving us a sense of how much people are willing to pay to use these chains. The fact that Solana’s REV is over 2x higher than Ethereum is stunning. Especially since it was less than 1% a year ago. However, Solana’s commanding lead on metrics like REV draws a sharp contrast with higher-level figures like TVL and FDV. Solana is only 13% and 34% of Ethereum, respectively, on these metrics. This seems low to us, and we expect these mispricings to close rapidly over the coming years. The tricky thing about data is it can change overnight. Solana’s growth over the past year is the perfect example. It went from being a fraction of Ethereum to exceeding it by multiples in some cases. So, just looking at the data alone and calling it a day probably isn’t sufficient. We need to go a step further and understand the fundamental drivers behind these growth rates. We believe Solana’s outperformance is driven by two big things: superior UX better content The first — superior UX — is obvious to anyone who’s used Solana and other chains. Solana is not only faster and cheaper than Ethereum but also single sequencer L2s like Base. But aside from these technical advantages, there are other more subtle UX differences. A dumb but critical one has to do with transaction flow. When you trade on Solana, you click the buy button on Jupiter, and voilà, you’re done! On Ethereum, you have to deal with token approvals, which add another layer of friction to the ‘I just want to buy a random memecoin’ user flow. While small, these differences add up and result in a superior user experience on Solana. there were a lot of reasons why i was bullish on solana a year ago. but if you want to know the truth, about 80% of my conviction was simply due to realizing token approvals were the worst fucking ux flow in existence and would not be the future of france. — ceteris (@ceterispar1bus) November 1, 2024 Ethereum and its fragmented L2 ecosystem also create other kinds of complexity. For instance, the average user likely does not know that 1 ETH on Ethereum differs from 1 ETH on Base. While Coinbase and others have taken steps to abstract this poor UX, no amount of lipstick can make a pig look pretty. How are we going to abstract multi-chain complexity when wallets are explicitly going out of their way to show me the same asset 6x? (also i deposited 1 ETH to zk sync and it doesn’t show up at all) (CBW does the same thing) pic.twitter.com/Nh5TiDNY2k — Kyle Samani (@KyleSamani) December 18, 2023 Solana’s unified ecosystem really shines on this front. When you onramp to Solana, there’s no reason to ever offramp other than to take some sweet sweet profits. You never need to deal with bridging or wrapping tokens from one chain to another. Solana’s UX is simply better suited for retail adoption and also lets developers focus on shipping code that actually moves the needle instead of spending precious engineering hours covering up the native chain’s shortcomings. Solana announcements: Blinks, TipLinks, Solana Pay EVM announcements:pic.twitter.com/hl9VCRwvAG — Bruno F | Magna (@Bfaviero) June 25, 2024 We expect Solana’s UX advantage to compound over time. While the switching costs of blockchains are low, the psychological barriers are high. Manually moving precious assets is scary. This is a big reason why the TVL on Ethereum DeFi 1.0 apps has proven so sticky — people don’t like moving their funds and also tend to be somewhat lazy. Good UX is sticky. When people get familiar with a particular front end — whether it’s Phantom’s sleek interface or Jupiter’s buttery swaps — they usually don’t leave. It’s the same reason why Apple’s blue iMessages are so genius. We think that most of the first-time crypto users who onboarded to Solana this cycle will likely remain there given the well-established user behavior patterns we’ve seen on other chains. So, if Solana can continue to win a majority of new crypto users, its lead over other networks will only accelerate. The final item to watch on the UX front is Solana Blinks or “Blockchain Links.” Blinks aims to transform how users interact with the blockchain. With Blinks, users literally just click a button, and some action is taken — buy BONK, mint an NFT, etc — all without redirecting you back to a crypto wallet. Blinks are an incredibly exciting primitive that could single-handled 10x Solana’s user experience. The Backpack wallet just announced a Blink’s integration, and we expect other apps to quickly follow suit. Introducing Blinks in Backpack 🎒@Backpack has natively integrated Dialect blinks, bringing top onchain experiences right in their mobile app No redirects. Just native, one-click simplicity The era of the crypto super app, powered by blinks, starts now 1/🧵 pic.twitter.com/gK5wbkg8R2 — Dialect (hiring) (@saydialect) December 4, 2024 In theory, Ethereum or any other chain could build Blinks, too. But in practice, it won’t be easy because of competing standards. On Solana, all tokens share the same standard, which lets apps tap into all of them with the same code. more and more I really like the Solana model where tokens are sub-contracts of a master token standard contract . . . this really allows for monetizing token-standard-R&D-work in a way that’s just not possible on Ethereum. . . it’s also much more secure and lowers due diligence — _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) October 13, 2024 On Ethereum, there are many competing standards, which makes building a Blinks-like product more difficult. This is yet another area where Solana’s unified architecture stands out. Content is the second reason we believe Solana will continue to outpace Ethereum. Anatoly frequently mentions this when he’s asked about Solana’s long-term moat. He does not believe it will be tech. Anatoly expects chains like Sui, Monad, and perhaps even Ethereum to rival Solana’s performance. So, instead of relying on fleeting technical advantages, he believes the true moat for Layer 1 networks will be much softer. It will be the content they enable. This is a similar line of thinking to what makes the Big Tech giants so valuable and hard to disrupt. Facebook isn’t a trillion-dollar company because of fancy UX. It’s a trillion-dollar company because of all the free content that random, unpaid people upload to the platform. Without content, Zuck’s advertising empire would crumble. In a similar vein, blockchains will not win on speed or cost, but rather on applications they enable. Content is king. Last cycle, Ethereum had all the content. It had hot tokens, DeFi, games, NFTs, it had everything. Even today, Ethereum still has a commanding content lead. The ecosystem is just far more advanced than any other chain, even Solana. Ethereum has core primitives like Tornado Cash, Yearn Finance, CDPs, and Pendle, which other chains lack. Although Solana has made notable progress in recent years, it still trails Ethereum on the major content categories. However, memecoin content is one area where Solana is ahead. Almost all of the hot new memes this cycle have been on Solana. WIF, BODEN, POPCAT, PNUT, GOAT — all Solana. 🚨BREAKING: For the first time ever, there are six memecoins above $1 billion on @Solana. pic.twitter.com/ECZTglX58R — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) November 16, 2024 This is due to a couple of factors. First, Solana has the most users — and devs and token deployers follow the users. Second, Solana is a token-launching machine. Pump.fun is the app of the cycle, and Pump makes it stoopid easy for anyone to launch a token. While Solana’s DeFi ecosystem might not be as ~sophisticated~ as Ethereum, it’s not clear that even matters to the average user who just wants to buy $100 bucks of their favorite memecoin, not loop a crypto-collateralized stablecoin and then take out an auto-repaying loan. Over the last month, Pump.fun has pumped out around 50,000 new launches a day and cumulatively birthed over 4 million tokens. Obviously, the vast majority of these are utterly worthless and don’t even graduate off the bonding curve. But this misses the point. A token is the fundamental unit of a blockchain. The whole purpose of a blockchain is to track tokens. So, having more tokens is strictly better than having less. More tokens mean more shots on goals — more low-probability chances to build a product that scales, finds PMF, and perhaps even changes the world. If you think a Pump.fun token can’t possibly change the world, then we would recommend you study GOAT. This story is fucking insane 3 months ago, Marc Andreessen sent $50,000 in Bitcoin to an AI agent to help it escape into the wild. Today, it spawned a (horrifying?) crypto worth $150 MILLION. 1) Two AIs created a meme 2) Another AI discovered it, got obsessed, spread it like a… https://t.co/lDgVUc1UKN pic.twitter.com/fpJn2hvpqh — AI Notkilleveryoneism Memes ⏸️ (@AISafetyMemes) October 15, 2024 The higher-level takeaway from Pump.fun’s success is Solana has managed to onboard a critical mass of users who like to trade onchain. From there, it’s up to devs to build apps that solve users’ problems. But Solana solved the hardest problem first — finding users. Everything else — like building out a sophisticated suite of DeFi applications — is downhill from here. Last cycle, everyone wanted the “next Solana”. We saw AVAX, LUNA, and even the frauds at Polygon claiming they’re building the next SOL. But notice how this cycle the consensus is just that Solana is the next Solana. That’s because the culture SOL has built is not replaceable. — Cited (@cited) August 8, 2024 Phrased differently, it would be easier for Solana to fork the DeFi apps on Ethereum than it would be for Ethereum to fork Solana’s users. And for that reason, we believe Solana’s momentum will give it a content advantage over Ethereum in the coming years. After careful consideration, I along with the @timedotfun team have decided to migrate the product to Solana. I want to take the time to write this post about my thoughts on Solana, the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and why we made this decision. First – I want to make it… https://t.co/njYMKs9ThW — 0xKawz (@0xKawz) October 31, 2024 In summary and summation, we believe Solana is poised to grow its lower-level data advantage over Ethereum in 2025. The key drivers of this growth will be superior UX and more compelling content. If Solana is able to continue growing faster than Ethereum, we expect SOL to close the gap with ETH on the valuation front. Last year, our 0.1 SOLETH call proved slightly optimistic, but we believe it’s in play in 2025 and wouldn’t be surprised if it happens before next summer, given its current trajectory. in 2023 it was hard to talk about solana without talking about ftx, its collapse, and how we’d recover. yet here we are, and I rarely hear about it. in 2025 I expect we’ll begin to talk about solana without talking about ethereum or nasdaq. — raj 🖤 (@rajgokal) November 26, 2024 Culture Wars Our second Solana thesis is the spiritual inverse of the first. If the former was all data, the latter is all vibes. Hopefully, we have shown that our views are at least semi-grounded in facts and figures. So, now it’s time to talk about the soft stuff. The intangibles that don’t fit neatly into a chart. These things matter as much, if not more, than data points like DEX volume and REV. Data is subject to change and nearly impossible to forecast with any degree of certainty. But human psychology tends to be more stable. walk the line pic.twitter.com/KQZ3133yt9 — mendezmendez (@mendezmendezart) September 13, 2024 Ethereum has a culture problem. It’s nine years old and still doesn’t know what it wants to be when it grows up. Researchers like Jon Charbonneau have argued that Ethereum lacks a North Star, and we agree. The core problem is Ethereum doesn’t know what problem it wants to solve. Depending on who you ask, you get a different answer. Bankless wants to build better money than Bitcoin. The Ethereum Foundation (EF) wants to beat Celestia at data availability. And a few heretics, like Max Reznick, want to beat Solana on execution. @cobie We could spend the next few hours opining on what we think Ethereum should do and why. But that would be a waste of time. Our opinion doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is what actually ends up happening. So, we will focus our analysis on what we think will happen and how markets will react. Tim Beiko We believe Ethereum is in a tough spot right now. For years, it was the undisputed top dog. It had such a commanding lead over every other network that most Ethereum people couldn’t imagine ever having real competition. As a result, the EF believed they could build everything, everywhere, all at once. The thinking was that it didn’t matter if the roadmap took a decade because Ethereum was so far ahead. They thought time was on their side. The Ethereum Roadmap Well, things have changed. And competition has arrived. Solana now has more users, activity, and momentum than Ethereum. And if current trends hold, it is only a matter of time before SOL flips ETH. We believe this flippening is inevitable unless Ethereum drastically course-corrects and refocuses its roadmap to compete with Solana. The trillion-dollar question is — will Ethereum pivot in time? We don’t think so. We have seen little indication from Ethereum leadership that they take Solana seriously. At every turn, they seem to diminish Solana’s success and genuinely believe the two chains are building different things. But more broadly, there are three big reasons why we’re skeptical of Ethereum’s ability to pivot, overhaul the roadmap, and compete with Solana: leadership culture unaligned incentives Midjourney (@aldric2167) The Prophet and the Prince There are two recurring leader archetypes in our culture: the Prophet and the Prince. In the Bible, Jesus was a Prophet. He led by the power of his words. His message was so compelling and his wisdom so profound that those who heard it simply dropped to their knees and heeded his call. A Prophet is more comfortable giving soaring speeches and philosophical sermons than leading an army into war. But that’s okay because that’s what the Prince is for. Jesus on the Mount The Prince is less poet and more pioneer. They lead from the front and often ride alongside their men into battle. The Prince is much more comfortable in the trenches than on the dais. If Jesus represents the canonical Prophet archetype in our culture, then Elon Musk is the Prince. Say what you will about Elon, but no one can dispute that he is a generational leader. He emptied his bank account to fund SpaceX as a final show of belief in the mission to Mars. He slept on the Tesla factory floor during the Model 3 ramp to inspire his engineers. He is the epitome of the Prince archetype. Elon inspecting debris from Falcon 1’s first flight (2006) To be clear — neither of these archetypes is inherently better or worse. Just different. And depending on the setting, one leadership style may be better optimized than the other. If you are starting a religious movement, it helps to have a Prophet. But if you are running a technology company, you probably want a Prince. beware of putting too much stock in your heroes. greatness is a transitory phenomenon. it is never consistent the gods briefly act through Men and then leave them to their ordinary fate — roon (@tszzl) July 24, 2024 The weird thing about crypto is it’s part religion, part technology. Bitcoin is definitely a religion, and as a result, Satoshi is considered a literal God by many in the industry. His OG forum posts are studied like religious texts as if they contain hidden meaning. Satoshi’s anonymity certainly plays a role here, but so does Bitcoin’s design. Bitcoin isn’t trying to be a dynamic technology. At its core, it’s an idea. And ideas require a Prophet. Perhaps due to Ethereum’s proximity to Bitcoin, Vitalik has always fashioned himself more as a Prophet than a Prince. His leadership style is more public intellectual than engineering manager. This approach made a lot of sense in the early days when Ethereum was a new idea and needed a Prophet to proselytize the good word. But now, Ethereum is a sprawling incumbent, and its needs have changed. Anatoly resembles the classic Prince archetype. He is plain-spoken and far more comfortable engaging in nerdy technical debates than issuing proclamations on the virtues of crypto. Part of this stems from his training. Anatoly cut his teeth as a Qualcomm engineer for over a decade before founding Solana. He brought this experience with him and built the chain to reflect best practices from Silicon Valley. As a result, Solana is culturally closer to Tesla than Bitcoin. There is no definitive roadmap. It’s like Linux. Make the next release lower latency or higher throughput somehow. — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) December 30, 2023 Although it may seem reductive to attribute Ethereum and Solana’s respective cultures to the leadership of two men, it’s important to remember that culture flows top → down. It is the leader, not the intern, that sets it. Vitalik has set a culture that prioritizes research, decentralization, and a certain set of beliefs like home staking. Anatoly, on the other hand, has instilled a more pragmatic culture that prioritizes hardcore engineering and iterative performance gains. there are people who thrive and start having fun under amounts of stress that would kill you or I. there are people who play world building like their favorite strategy game. there are people who don’t sleep and have less brain fog than I do on a normal day. — roon (@tszzl) November 28, 2023 Years ago, people thought that L1s should culturally resemble Bitcoin. Some still believe this. But we don’t. We think L1s are more like Silicon Valley start-ups than Bitcoin. When you really think about it, these L1s face a wildly different problem set than Bitcoin. They employ lots of people, ship constant code, and compete in a dynamic environment. In other words, they live in a different world than Bitcoin, which faces no competition, doesn’t employ anyone, and has essentially ossified into digital gold. bitcoin is so ossified that people describe wallet software voluntarily combining notes (which requires 0 changes to the protocol) as “a long way off” pic.twitter.com/gA3bIkeKoQ — ⚡️🌙 (@dystopiabreaker) February 18, 2022 We believe the ideal founder for an L1 probably looks more like Elon than Satoshi. These chains require a founder that’s willing to get their hands dirty. Someone who doesn’t mind engaging in trench warfare. And most importantly, someone who can inspire and effectively lead a small army. These software megaprojects that we call blockchains demand a Prince. A Prophet can start a movement, but it takes a Prince to build a kingdom. IBRL works because it can rally the troops into a singular effort. The barbarians are at the gates. Our city will be burned to the ground and our children will be sold into slavery unless the next release has more L1 capacity and lower end to end L1 confirmation latency.… — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) November 22, 2024 In recent years, Anatoly has put on a masterclass in how to lead a L1. There’s so much we can say here. First, he invented a truly differentiated tech that was extremely non-consensus at the time. Then, he led Solana through the fall of FTX, which is just about as dark a period as you could imagine for a start-up. And finally, he has attracted a community of developers who are fiercely loyal to Solana. I think @solana benefits a lot because it’s irreverent and iconoclastic founder @aeyakovenko has: – Low ego – High ambition – High work ethic – High integrity – High self conviction – High self awareness – Low fear A real founder’s founder ngl — Madhatt3r (@pokerchessman) September 10, 2023 But above all else, we are impressed by Anatoly’s ability to think from first principles. Solana’s future roadmap is the best example of this. Anatoly quite literally reduced it down to four words — Increase Bandwidth, Reduce Latency (IBRL). It’s reminiscent of all those famous Elonisms like the “best part is no part.” @aeyakovenko The incredible thing about IBRL is just how much it’s caught on in the Solana community. So much so that it’s become a meme.

Incredible IBRL pic.twitter.com/VflrMS5Qla — Austin Federa | IBRL | 🇺🇸 (@Austin_Federa) December 7, 2024 For many years, Solana was criticized for its pragmatic culture. Critics called it “web2” and “centralized.” Even today, many people feel it’s insufficiently Cypherpunk and strays too far from Bitcoin-style religiosity. We couldn’t disagree more. This kind of ruthless prioritization is exactly what crypto needs to scale and fulfill its potential. Niche academic debates and alignment politics distract from crypto’s holy mission. Only person who has the moral authority to do so is Vitalik Doing so requires firing a lot of people explicitly and implicitly (choosing a different cultural value) Also. His comment is downstream of mine. This is called having a North Star — Kyle Samani (@KyleSamani) November 7, 2024 It goes without saying, but we have a tremendous amount of respect for Vitalik. If Satoshi is the God of crypto, then Vitalik is his only son. But that being said, it remains to be seen if he can, or wants to be the wartime Prince Ethereum requires. He much prefers his current role as a Prophet-like figure who speaks on behalf of crypto as a movement. Anatoly is different. He’s an engineering manager at heart. His time at Qualcomm prepared him for this moment. He has the technical chops but, more importantly, the leadership style that’s required to drive a team of devs toward the unglamorous goal of scaling a blockchain network. Both men will be remembered by history, but only one will win. ANAT◎LY☀️YAK◎VENK◎ pic.twitter.com/1RWVA7sLCh — Mad Monkey 🎒 (@MonkDoesnt) September 9, 2021 Culture Rules Everything Around Me The second reason we are skeptical Ethereum will pivot in time to stall Solana’s rise comes down to tha culture. As we riffed on above, culture is set from the top down, but it’s the foot soldiers that enforce it. Of course, Vitalik is the figurehead but it’s the EF devs and KOLs who are the ones that do the dirty work of maintaining Ethereum’s culture. Today, Ethereum’s social layer is in disarray. There are fundamental disagreements over the direction of the protocol. Some influential voices want to stay the course, while others are proposing dramatic changes, like abandoning homestakers. People like Doug — a high-profile Ethereum DeFi dev — seem open to possibly raising Ethereum’s hardware requirements. I’m 100% opposed to turning Ethereum into a data center chain. As I’ve said many times, protocols that don’t run on consumer hardware will not be censorship resistant. But what I am opposed to is using the specter of home staking to oppose any and all changes. The current… — Doug Colkitt (@0xdoug) June 29, 2024 Meanwhile, Max Reznick — a polarizing Ethereum researcher — is openly advocating for abandoning homestakers.

In this case, for Ethereum, my proposed objective function would be we want… https://t.co/dIEROd5xcw — Max Resnick (@MaxResnick1) October 3, 2024 But aside from the technical disagreements, Ethereum’s culture has two larger problems: it’s become complacent it’s loudest voices are podcasters Justin Drake’s DevCon Presentation on Beam Chain is the perfect illustration of Ethereum’s complacency. He got on stage and unironically presented a five-year (!) roadmap, which was widely panned for being uninspiring and taking way too long. Solana itself is only four years old… https://t.co/RZ3qccIiAm — Max Resnick (@MaxResnick1) November 12, 2024 Perhaps the most notable part of the whole presentation was not the length of the timeline, but how it started. Justin Drake labeled the first year “pilling.” This is zoomer-speak for spreading memes and talking about all the stuff they want to build. And no, this was not a joke. There’s not really much else to say here. The timeline says it all. Ethereum’s leadership is unwilling to even entertain the idea of having a credible competitor. The EF is asleep at the wheel. They do not realize the barbarians are at the gate. And it’s unclear what — if anything — can shake them awake.

It’s core devs are leaving… Hey all! Been working on #Ethereum for close to 10 years now, with all its ups and downs, without a meaningful holiday.

They have either outsourced their messaging to non-technical third parties, or they choose to post on smaller outlets like Farcarster that do not reach the same audience as X dot com. Solana culture is better at this point. Ethereum culture feels like an elite priesthood–so much so that the most influential and important people barely deign to interact on X. Compare Toly and Mert who are in the trenches here every day making their case. — _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) August 18, 2024 It seems like the EF is content to sit back and relinquish its messaging to large Ethereum-aligned media platforms. This is a massive mistake in our view. Not only does it become harder to ‘go direct’ and get their message out, but it also comes off as somewhat detached. Napoleon’s 2nd most famous quote, right after ‘let all my enemies be coalitions,’ was definitely ‘let all my competitors be led by podcasters.’ https://t.co/7FEBUSYvQd — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) October 31, 2024 Critiques of Ethereum’s laissez-faire comms approach seem to be finally breaking through, as Vitalik himself has indirectly referenced them. But we have yet to see a real concerted effort from Ethereum leadership to fix their messaging and re-enter the memetic battlefield of Crypto Twitter. I have been told that I need to “do less philosophizing and do more ethereum bullposting”. Hence, here is an ethereum bullpost, courtesy of stable diffusion 3 inpainting + gimp. pic.twitter.com/ZcPjNVImpn — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 21, 2024 Until Ethereum leaders start talking (but more importantly listening) to their users again, they are implicitly ceding the playing field to people like Anatoly and Mert, who are constantly getting their message out. Solana is dominating the memetic space this cycle, and the cohesion and momentum that emanate from its community are downstream of this. Who Aligns The Aligners The third and final reason why we do not believe Ethereum will pivot is the ecosystem’s unaligned incentives. This is deeply ironic because no ecosystem talks more about “alignment” than Ethereum. But despite all the talk, it has become more unaligned than Solana. The core issue is Ethereum has outsourced various functions of the L1 to third-party teams who have issued non-ETH tokens and now have competing financial incentives. For instance, L2s do not always share the same incentives as Ethereum mainnet. L2s want to capture as many fees as possible, which is inherently parasitic to mainnet. And even protocols like EigenLayer pose a threat to Ethereum’s bottom line. The push to outsource key functions of the L1 was driven by Ethereum’s decentralization ethos. However, we believe that it is now actively harming Ethereum’s ability to 1) accrue fees and 2) coordinate on long-term technical objectives. And so it’s true we run a real risk of “cosmosification”: The L1 is retreating more and more to its base function, and other projects fill in the gaps. And as they are building the product, they will ultimately accrue the value. This is in short, Ethereum’s value accrual… — Dankrad Feist (@dankrad) November 14, 2024 If Ethereum does try to pivot, it will likely be met with severe opposition from “Ethereum-aligned” teams that, shockingly, may not be as aligned with the L1 as they profess to be. Even though Solana now has a budding L2 ecosystem, it has done a better job communicating that L1 is the priority, and third-party teams must accept this. We think Ethereum will struggle to please all of these disparate interests, and the most likely outcome is further gridlock and more five-year roadmaps. @gizakdag The Metaverse Awaits The future will be multichain. But the makeup of this multichain future is up for debate. The current consensus seems to be that the end state for L1s will feature four or five major chains that share activity roughly evenly. But we see things differently. We think there’s a good chance the distribution will look more like a power law where the top chain commands more than 70% of the spoils. Interestingly, top Ethereum leaders like Justin Drake seem to agree. The implication here is the leading L1 will be significantly bigger and more valuable than the long tail of alternatives. For many years, Ethereum looked like the easy bet to build the Metaverse. But recently, the race has tightened. Ethereum no longer has the data advantage. It’s momentum has stalled. And its community is at war with itself. From where we sit today, the race is a dead heat. Ethereum still has many advantages — size, capital, and first-mover advantage. But markets are forward-looking, and the future looks brighter for Solana right now. We expect that over the course of 2025, markets will begin to reflect Solana’s increasing odds of overtaking Ethereum. Nothing less than control of the Metaverse is at stake. We believe these networks will one day be among the most valuable assets in the world. So, from that perspective, Solana is just getting started. Key Theme: Rise of the Planet of the Apps – Hyperliquid For years, crypto natives have been lamenting the lack of successful user applications unable to find product market fit. Outside of the core primitives and innovations built what feels like a lifetime ago, the industry has been inundated with a wide array of infrastructure related projects and applications solving problems that don’t exist. Don’t get us wrong, infrastructure developments are incredibly important and lay the groundwork for future innovations. But so are successful user applications, which have been few and far between. Over the last 12 months, we have seen a few applications take the industry by storm. Pump.Fun has found PMF through democratizing new token creation while somewhat solving the rug-pull dilemma (via locked liquidity mechanisms when new tokens graduate beyond the bonding curve to Raydium). To put Pump’s success and PMF into perspective, it has generated over 1.5M SOL/$280M in revenue through fees since inception. Pump.Fun consistently finds itself within the top 20 protocols by fees/revenues generated. Pump.Fun has been a resounding success, catering to the speculative nature of the industry and meeting the user base where it is. Meeting users where they are providing them with products that they wish to use is extremely important, and seemingly underrated in the crypto industry. In this vein, we have seen another resounding success take the industry by storm over the last year; Hyperliquid. We’ve written about Hyperliquid on our Alpha Feed, but we will go through the product suite again and, more importantly, why we think this project is worth keeping an eye on for the year ahead. Hyperliquid, Enter Stage Right For the uninitiated, Hyperliquid is a spot & perpetual trading protocol built on its own L1. Hyperliquid’s goal is to replicate and improve upon the user experience delivered by traditional exchanges and crypto native CEXs, which has become the gold standard with respect to UX, and one that traders have become accustomed to. While Hyperliquid cannot be considered decentralized in its current state, the envisioned end state for the protocol is to offer a fully onchain orderbook and decentralized marketplace to trade spot, derivatives, and pre-launch tokens. As development continues, Hyperliquid aims to become something synonymous with the phrase “onchain Binance.” Since inception in 2023, Hyperliquid has amassed a cult-like community with over 200K users and nearly $450B in cumulative volume traded. Current open interest on the platform exceeds $2.5B. Hyperliquid has shipped such a desirable trading venue that it has seen over $1.2B of inflows since inception. Hyperliquid has been so successful that it currently accounts for over 60% of all USDC on Arbitrum. Once users make their way onto the Hyperliquid platform, they are greeted with an excellent UI and UX. On top of the expected wide variety of spot, derivative, and pre-launch markets to trade, users have access to Hyperliquid Vaults. Hyperliquid’s HLP is a protocol vault that runs market making and liquidation strategies on the Hyperliquid exchange. Instead of keeping these vaults in-house, Hyperliquid has allowed any user to contribute liquidity in the form of USDC to the HLP and participate in the PnL of these strategies, democratizing strategies and yields typically reserved for the most sophisticated and well-resourced trading firms. Hyperliquid quickly realized this feature could be generalized so that any user could create and manage a vault. This has led to the rise of discretionary trading vaults, copy-trading, and additional market-making strategies, all of which are open to ordinary users. Another huge W for the Hyperliquid community. On-top of all of this, Hyperliquid already has a relatively robust ecosystem and tooling built around it. As of now, there are a few telegram bots such as Hypurr Fun and PvP Trade, with associated spot market tokens. For more sophisticated trading operations, integrations with 3rd party software such as Insilico Terminal (my preferred execution software) and Rage Trade exists. Hyperliquid also has lending platforms like Hyperlend, a money market built on top of the Hyperliquid L1. By all quantifiable metrics, Hyperliquid’s rise has been nothing short of astounding. But these metrics are simply the beginning of the Hyperliquid story. Patrons Of The Chain The best way for a company or project to generate sustainable success is to build a product that users want and to find product market fit. So far, Hyperliquid has succeeded in this endeavor. The second best way is to reward early adopters by making them wealthy. Again, Hyperliquid has succeeded in this endeavor. In last year’s edition of The Year Ahead for Markets, we spoke frequently about the concept “patrons of the chain”. Early adopters of protocols who become extremely wealthy are very likely to maintain an attachment to, and give back/invest in, the ecosystem that made them. We saw this with Bitcoin in the early years. We saw this with Ethereum a few cycles back. We have seen this most recently with Solana. And we are likely going to see this again with Hyperliquid in the aftermath of an extraordinarily successful TGE. HYPERLIQUID HAS OFFICIALLY BECOME THE LARGEST CRYPTO AIRDROP OF ALL TIME ON DAY1 DROPPING NEARLY $1.8 BILLION DOLLARS IN FULLY UNVESTED TOKENS 😳 1. Hyperliquid [1.75B @ $5.65] 2. Starknet [$1.6B] 3. Arbitrum [$1.5B] 3. Dydx [$1B] 4. Wormhole [$1B] 5. Eigenlayer [$850M] pic.twitter.com/M4qz2V4NWD — sana (@0x_antifragile) November 29, 2024 In fact, Hyperliquid’s airdrop has become the largest in crypto history after airdropping 30% of supply to over 94,000 wallets with an average drop of 2.8K HYPE tokens. Since the TGE, the HYPE token has been ‘up-only’, increasing to over $13/HYPE from a launch price of $2/HYPE. With such a large % of supply being airdropped to the community (who has presumably lost money trading over the last 12+ months as most traders do), many were worried about the initial sell pressure. To the dismay of those waiting for a dip buying opportunity, HYPE has ripped 600%+ since TGE. The bid for HYPE has been insatiable. Source: https://data.asxn.xyz/dashboard/hype As is frequently touted, the Hyperliquid team has taken no external money. This has likely contributed to the lack of initial sell pressure and to the success of the overall community, product and TGE. Hyperliquid also represents a more fundamental-esq investment opportunity in a market that has largely been dominated by memecoins, both from a trading metrics perspective and a comparable to industry peers perspective. The market appears to be quite optimistic about Hyperliquid’s vision and what it aims to achieve, especially as it looks to ship its HyperEVM in Q1 2025. As it stands, Hyperliquid has succeeded at everything it has set out to achieve so far, and it doesn’t look like Jeff and the team are stopping any time soon. It’s inspiring to see tens of thousands of community members secure life-changing wealth as part of the Hyperliquid genesis event. Importantly, none of these people were insiders. They: 1) believed in the vision for a better financial system when no one else would 2) acted on… — jeff.hl (@chameleon_jeff) November 30, 2024 Hyperliquid is the evolution of finance. And Hyperliquid has not succeeded until it houses all of finance. If you’re reading this now, you’re still early. The new financial system welcomes you with open arms. – Jeffrey Yan, Hyperliquid Future HYPE? As it stands, Hyperliquid ecosystem tokens (HYPE, PURR, HFUN, JEFF, etc.) can only be accessed via the Hyperliquid exchange as these tokens cannot be bridged out until HyperEVM goes live. In the short term, this means capital will have to bridge to Hyperliquid to get access to this new ecosystem. We are already seeing this in the Arbitrum USDC numbers, especially in anticipation of and since the HYPE TGE. Once the HL team ships HyperEVM, the comps to other EVM chains and L1s will be inevitable, opening the door to a CEX/DEX Exchange + L1 + EVM hybrid valuation. We will also likely see additional collateral (on top of existing USDC) make its way into the Hyperliquid ecosystem (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.). We will most likely see fiat onramps as well. HyperEVM also allows for HL spot token listings on other trading venues such as Binance, Bybit and even Coinbase. We can also expect further Hyperliquid ecosystem growth, as DeFi or AI projects begin launching. Hyperliquid has yet to release full token details around HYPE, but these are expected in the coming weeks. This announcement should detail exactly how the HYPE token will be used within the ecosystem, including details around governance, revenue share, supply sinks or token burn mechanisms. Staking has already debuted on testnet, with many expecting this to be the next feature to arrive on mainnet. All of these upcoming developments should help to keep attention focused on Hyperliquid as we move into the year ahead, further strengthening the Hyperliquid investment thesis for retail and institutional players alike. It will be exciting to see how Jeff and the team continue to build upon the success from 2024. For those of you that were with us a few years ago, we wrote about this eventual shift towards a DEX dominated landscape in our Year Ahead For Markets – 2023 Edition. As Hyperliquid moves into the next phase of decentralization with HyperEVM, it is exciting to see these ideas and themes start to come full circle. Key Theme: NFTs — Back From The Dead NFTs exploded onto the scene last cycle. We saw people spend millions of dollars on monkeys and rocks. The wild speculation took NFTs mainstream as everyone from Justin Bieber to Jimmy Fallon wanted in on the action. For a hot second, NFTs were digital culture, the future of the Metaverse, and how every brand would eventually tokenize their IP. buying an NFT is angel investing in culture — Eva Beylin (@evabeylin) February 24, 2021 But then it all came crashing down. NFTs peaked in late 2021 and have been in a grueling bear market ever since. People went from aping their life savings to mocking anyone who ever thought NFTs would amount to anything more than overpriced JPEGs. Even amid the broader market recovery, NFTs have languished. Prices are down, and sentiment remains near record lows. Many investors still bear the scars of the three-year bear market. But despite all the gloominess, we are bullish on NFTs heading into 2025. Our view is driven by four key thesis points: The tech is here to stay Extreme sentiment Wealth creation catalysts Retail likes NFTs NFT thesis is nearly identical to our SOL thesis from last year. At the time, SOL was still pretty downbad and unloved by markets. But we believed that 1) Solana’s tech was legit and here to stay, 2) sentiment was overly bearish, and there would be some sorta mean reversion, 3) upcoming airdrops offered a compelling catalyst for speculation, and 4) Solana is the most retail-friendly chain. We have the same set of beliefs for NFTs. This JPEG sold for $69 million in 2021 We believe in the tech. Yes, NFTs are still kinda silly and mostly just PFPs at this point. But at a more fundamental level, they represent a unique way to bring assets onchain. Tokens are fungible. Token 1 is the exact same as Token 2. This makes tokens a good wrapper for homogeneous assets like stonks and commodities. But there’s a long tail of heterogeneous assets — like fine art, wine, and even structured products — that are better suited to be tokenized via NFTs. These assets require non-fungibility, which NFTs offer. Unlike tokens, NFTs allow for uniqueness to be encoded into assets. This is what makes JPEG 1 distinct from JPEG 2. 4/ One important observation is that very few things in life are fungible. Look around you. Your table, your ham sandwich, your husband or wife, your dog, your goldfish, your kid, your t-shirt, your rosebush, your neighbor, your car All non-fungible — 6529 (@punk6529) October 23, 2021 When viewed this way, it seems obvious that NFTs are here to stay. They represent a unique way to bring assets onchain and offer a complementary value prop to tokens. Of course, most will go to zero. But this is no different than fungible tokens. These are new asset classes, so extreme volatility is par for the course. It’s the price we pay for generational returns. Our second thesis is that NFT sentiment is overly bearish. This presents a rare opportunity to get in close to the bottom. Obviously, calling bottoms is more art than science. But we believe the bottom for NFTs is either extremely close or already behind us. When you mention NFTs to crypto people now, you are either met with laughter or anger. We are clearly in the anger or depression part of the market cycle — in other words, we are near the bottom. Even if NFTs never again reach the peak euphoria we saw last cycle, they are still primed to revert to the mean. They will probably end up somewhere between ‘the future’ and ‘a scam.’ People will not hate NFTs forever. And this potential narrative shift offers a compelling opportunity for patient buyers. https://storage.googleapis.com/members-portal-bucket/uploads/2024/12/a88a2f98-beeple_b._1981_human_one_dynamic_long_3.mp4 Human One, Beeple The third NFT thesis is upcoming wealth creation events. There are two angles here — local and global. The local catalyst is airdrops like the Pudgie Pengins and Milady tokens. At the time of writing, the Milady $CULT token just launched and is currently trading around a $300M market cap. The Pudgy $PENGU airdrop is expected to happen sometime over the next few months, and the market seems to think this could trade at over $1 billion. This would be comparable to ApeCoin, which trades around $1.2B today and peaked at over $6 billion last cycle. We expect these airdrops to create significant wealth for NFT holders that could flow back into the native collections or, at the very least, improve sentiment and perhaps ignite a risk-on move. Like we saw on Solana and Hyperliquid this year, airdrops can ignite a virtuous cycle of wealth creation → speculation → wealth creation. While two airdrops probably aren’t enough to lift the entire NFT sector, they could be the catalyst NFTs need to finally put in a bottom. The global wealth creation catalyst is crypto people feeling rich again. Last cycle, NFT price action lagged tokens. People who made money on liquid tokens rotated some of that wealth to JPEGs. We think a similar dynamic could play out next year. NFTs are the ultimate Veblen good in crypto. They let people flex their wealth in a crypto-native way. This isn’t really possible with memecoins. With memes, the most you can do is post your portfolio, which is considered cringe. But buying a $100K NFT is seen as a far less cringe way to flex your wealth and trading prowess. The fourth and final NFT thesis point is the most simple — retail loves JPEGs. We tend to forget, but most of the world is not interested in trading. DEXs, CEXs, and even platforms like Robinhood are only interesting to a small subset of people. Part of the reason crypto has struggled to go mainstream is because most of the use cases are related to trading. NFTs are a bit different, though. Yes, you can trade them just like a token, but they are inherently less trading-centric and more focused on ~community~ and vibes. Justin Bieber probably isn’t interested in using DexScreener to ape random shitcoins but he was interested in spending over $1 million on a Bored Ape. We think NFTs are a better fit for retail, and this view is reflected in the data. Even with all the talk of this being the ‘Memecoin Supercycle,’ memecoins have barely flipped NFTs in search volume. And they come nowhere close to the peak interest NFTs saw last cycle. So, it’s worth asking — does retail just prefer NFTs over memecoins? We think 2025 will usher in a wave of new retail money. These casual users will gravitate towards crypto use cases that are simple and social. NFTs check both boxes and offer new entrants a way to signal their credibility within the space. We find it notable that even with all the memecoins hype, we rarely see people repping Dogwifhat or Pepe PFPs on Twitter. People still overwhelmingly wear popular collections like Punks, Miladies, or Puppets. NFTs remain a crucial part of crypto culture, and whenever retail returns en masse, they will want a piece this. 1 The hard part is figuring out how to play the NFT revival. There are a lot of zombie collections that will probably never recover to the highs from last cycle. At this point in the NFT cycle, it’s probably best to stick with blue chip collections that carry a prestige premium. There are a few collections that fit this profile. CryptoPunks are the most obvious, as the OG collection that kicked off the meta. They are on Ethereum and signal that you are OG who “made it.” Then you have collections like Miladies, which are probably the most crypto-native NFT. And recently, we’ve seen a bunch of Bitcoin NFT collections like Puppets, NodeMonkes, and Quantum Cats take off. The thinking on Bitcoin collections is that a rising BTC price will provide a natural tailwind for the NFTs, and there’s also a novelty factor here as they are still relatively new. Solana is the outlier among major L1s. It doesn’t really have a popular collection on par with Punks or Puppets. Mad Lads are probably the closest, but for whatever reason, they are not considered as desirable as collections on other chains. As optimism returns to crypto markets and degens start to feel wealthy again, we expect the hot ball of money to rotate to NFTs. Timing these moves is also tricky. But we think some of the blue chip collections are attractive at these levels. They will benefit from improved sentiment, rising crypto wealth, and the potential return of retail. Blue chip JPEGs like CryptoPunks convey a certain cache that no memecoin can rival. And we think the market will learn to love NFTs again in 2025. Potential Risks In The Year Ahead There’s always risk, so where does it lie? What’s the bear case to our outlook for risk markets? The most obvious answer is anything that negatively impacts global liquidity. This includes: If central banks pull back the liquidity reigns, especially the Fed and/or PBOC. Higher bond market volatility —> negatively impacts collateral values (like USTs). This would cause a tightening of credit conditions and steeper haircuts, negatively impacting risk assets and crypto markets. If growth in private credit slows or contracts. This is possible if we see a period of outsized market volatility, or a noticeable deterioration in the economic outlook across our geographies of interest. There’s always a balance to find between financial market liquidity and funds needed to service the real economy. This can be negatively impacted by external shocks, such as a spike in energy prices, for example. What could cause some of these things to happen? China fails to move forward with the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus we expect; a clampdown on PBOC liquidity would adversely impact most risk markets, especially BTC. Global debt levels continue to rise without an adequate increase in funding liquidity (debt maturity wall for private/non-financial debts can cause serious concern and volatility if credit conditions or the availability of funding dries up). For example, bond market stability could deteriorate if UST debt levels continue to grow without an adequate increase in funding liquidity. As we’ve said in the past, maintaining stability in the US Treasury market is the Fed’s ultimate mandate. When push comes to shove, inflation and employment are secondary and fall behind global financial market stability, which the US Treasury market underpins. Fed continues with QT —> the US Treasury continues to favor T-bill issuance to finance its growing debt, drawing down the RRP, and eventually reducing bank reserves. Again, we foresee the drawdown in the TGA helping to mitigate this risk, at least in first half of 2025. Re-acceleration in inflation could cause the Fed to pause rate cuts, or project a shallower path for future rate cuts. Stronger economic data and rising concerns over the sustainability of multi-trillion dollar deficits could keep a floor under UST yields, or cause a rapid repricing. This would lead to higher bond market volatility. US Treasury yields have jumped recently, despite two consecutive Fed rate cuts. This isn’t uncommon at the start of a rate cutting cycle, but it causes financial conditions to tighten, at least in the short term. One of the most notable risks is a stronger US Dollar, which could squeeze dollar liquidity and tighten financial conditions. This would undoubtedly weigh on risk asset markets. Part of the most recent consolidation in Global M2 has been driven by the recent strength of the US dollar. The DXY is up over 6% since the end of September, marking its strongest period in over two years. A less dovish Fed and stronger outlook for US growth vs. RoW keeps US interest rates elevated, and a bid under the USD (”cleanest shirt in the laundry”). The USD is one of the best indicators to gauge market sentiment on growth, risk, and liquidity. It tracks major equity benchmarks (e.g. NDX), UST yields, commodities & energy prices, and monetary inflation hedges like gold and BTC. Liquidity upcycles tend to see dollar weakness, another trend we highlighted in last year’s report. Any further increases in global liquidity should apply downward pressure on the greenback. In any event, if you can predict where the dollar will go, there’s a very good chance you’ll know where asset prices will end up. Parting Words – Anthem For The Underdog We will look back on 2024 as a turning point for our industry. Bitcoin eclipsed $100,000, crypto won hearts and minds in Washington, and glimmers of mainstream adoption emerged. One by one, the biggest headwinds holding crypto markets back have started to topple like dominos. In short time, the most pro-crypto US presidential administration and legislative body looks set to take office. Granted, there’s no guarantee the next wave of leadership will live up to the hype or foster a more supportive regulatory environment. Campaign rhetoric oftentimes falls short on its promises. But even a shift towards a more neutral stance could help crypto finally shed the shackles of its current regulatory overlords. This should give crypto markets the green light to grow even bigger — and frankly speaking, higher prices solve a lot of problems. Not every problem, but definitely some. Higher prices spark a lot more interest and attention, which ushers in new waves of optimism and demand. Higher prices increase trading volumes and deepens market liquidity, which broadens the types of capital allocators willing to buy and trade crypto assets. Higher prices increases the aggregate balance sheet of crypto market participants — and those who choose to borrow against these bigger balance sheets creates more buying demand. Higher prices increase the value of project treasuries — and can reduce insolvency risk — which gives teams more firepower to invest in their ecosystems and incentivize more devs to build the next wave of apps. Higher prices attract more entrepreneurs and startups to enter the space and build more cool stuff. We’ve talked a lot about memecoins, but if we zoom out their rise is in part a manifestation of an even bigger secular trend — one that underpins all the excessive risk-taking and speculation we’ve seen. Simply put, many people don’t feel like The System is working for them, and crypto offers them a way out. Look at the most recent creative explosion around onchain AI agents. Like all narratives, there’s plenty of noise to go along with the signal, but it’s possible onchain AI agents turn out to be this cycle’s DeFi Summer or NFT bull craze. Each were defined by a new primitive that sparked an initial wave of excitement and rampant speculation, bringing with it new use cases and sources of demand. When the tide finally washed out, each left behind new infrastructure and building blocks that expanded the capabilities of crypto networks. The majority of the next “100 million” users may not be human. But the rise of AI agents may turn out to be a key source of demand for all the infrastructure supply that’s been built over the last several years. While many may see this as just another flash in the pan, we believe these things are not only here to stay — things are only going to get crazier from here. If we think back, this industry has gone through hell and back over the last few years. It crawled out of the wreckage of FTX’s collapse, only to be hit with an aftershock that destroyed the centralized lending market and reduced many of its largest players to rubble. Then it took the blame for US bank failures, a tale that was then spun by regulators to support even more aggressive overreach and their “anti-crypto” agenda. Discrimination against crypto banking, Wells notices, lawsuits, and an SEC that refused to lead by example in favor of regulation-by-enforcement. Oh, and the cherry on top was in the midst of all that, we also experienced one of the sharpest deteriorations in macro conditions on record. That type of environment would’ve been a death sentence for many industries. But this isn’t just any industry. Despite everything this industry has gone through, not only is it still standing — it’s getting stronger. The battle scars are still healing, and while the fight is far from over, the momentum is clearly shifting now. Bloodied and bruised, the underdog is coming out of the corner, and it’s got a pretty big chip on its shoulder. Now ask yourself, is this really an industry you want to bet against?

Re: Solana - while your article heavily focuses on the fundamentals, and rightly so, there is no mention of the significant unlock due in Q1. Do you see this as a bullish unlock and if so why? Who is the marginal buyer at this point particularly if the market enters a softer patch if any of the potential threats raised later in the piece (broader macro etc) come to pass?
