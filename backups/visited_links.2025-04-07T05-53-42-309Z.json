They would look to the maturity test to see if they could simultaneously exit out of the safe harbor (stop disclosures/reporting etc) and would have retroactive relief from SEC enforcement on their past public sale/launch at exit if they hit the reqs....

If applications are the moat and high-perfomance is not necessarily a differentiator then we're basically saying that business development/ partnerships could be a key differentiator? If you could expand your thoughts on how these blockchains can build moats that would be helpful. Also, projects like Eigenlayer and Celestia should be no-brainers for long-term investment. But like L2s, their tokens are down only and tokenomics are basically lacking value added benefits. Most tokens have no use outside of governance. Are there any that stand out to you as different?As a future area of research, I would love to see a deep dive on the best tokenomics in the industry, consider value driving features and unlocks, inflation etc. Reply This comment is private and only viewable by group members. Your group enabling access: Everyone Muhammad YusufMar 24, 2025 • 11:18 PMThanks, Shanners. How chains can build moats and best tokenomics practices are great topics, and we will follow up with a piece on them soon. When it comes to utility beyond governance, I find some L1 tokens to be in an interesting spot. Sui and Solana for example have rent/burn mechanisms to allocate state and manage state growth but that isn't strong enough to push back on token unlocks. We'll look more into these. Reply",

Your group enabling access: Everyone Neel DaftaryMar 25, 2025 • 2:43 AMMegavault (27.6mn) is relatively small compared to HLP (297mn). Both vaults have seen massive outflows of capital over the last 3 months HLP down from 540mn and Megavault down from 80mn.Both receive a portion of the trading fees from the protocols along with the PNL from trading. It’s difficult to benchmark the performance of these vaults against each other as the TVL deposited in both has been constantly changing over the last few months.But Megavault estimates annual pay based on the previous months returns annualised (which is -7% right now) & using the same methodology HLP estimate would be (-9.2% - No thanks to the Hyperliquid whale)I think the vault that outperforms is the one with more trading volumes over a long enough time frame. The protocol with more trading volume/TVL ratio gets to earn more from trading fees with the trading returns across both platforms converging over time unless the MMing strategy is significantly different (which I doubt it is).

Your group enabling access: Everyone Jordan Yeakley, CFAJan 19, 2025 • 2:54 AMYeah, farcaster high level metrics aren’t pretty rn, but you can’t tell that when using it. The timeline is the same as twitter, as in like, for a single person, it doesn’t matter if there are 40k or 5 million users bc the experience is roughly the same. Also the user demographic on farcaster is a higher value on average, lots of KOL type people. Farcaster probably does a better job of algo boosting signal from builder type people, almost like twitter did last cycle. Regardless, they stuff they are building there is really cool. Rn frames v2 is the biggest tailwind. On a longer time frame, I think capabilities of web3 social will be too much for web2 to compete with, but short term yeah Clanker may rely on ecosystem projects to expand its reach. I’ll be looking at doing a follow up to this once the ecosystem forms better and will look to cover farcaster in that Reply",
