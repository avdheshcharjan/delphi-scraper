If applications are the moat and high-perfomance is not necessarily a differentiator then we're basically saying that business development/ partnerships could be a key differentiator? If you could expand your thoughts on how these blockchains can build moats that would be helpful. Also, projects like Eigenlayer and Celestia should be no-brainers for long-term investment. But like L2s, their tokens are down only and tokenomics are basically lacking value added benefits. Most tokens have no use outside of governance. Are there any that stand out to you as different?As a future area of research, I would love to see a deep dive on the best tokenomics in the industry, consider value driving features and unlocks, inflation etc. Reply This comment is private and only viewable by group members. Your group enabling access: Everyone Muhammad YusufMar 24, 2025 • 11:18 PMThanks, Shanners. How chains can build moats and best tokenomics practices are great topics, and we will follow up with a piece on them soon. When it comes to utility beyond governance, I find some L1 tokens to be in an interesting spot. Sui and Solana for example have rent/burn mechanisms to allocate state and manage state growth but that isn't strong enough to push back on token unlocks. We'll look more into these. Reply",

Your group enabling access: Everyone gustavMar 12, 2025 • 4:17 PMReport snippet \"HL democratizes access to its proprietary market making strategies through its HLP vault;\" wondering how does dydx's megavault compare Reply This comment is private and only viewable by group members. Your group enabling access: Everyone Neel DaftaryMar 25, 2025 • 2:43 AMMegavault (27.6mn) is relatively small compared to HLP (297mn). Both vaults have seen massive outflows of capital over the last 3 months HLP down from 540mn and Megavault down from 80mn.Both receive a portion of the trading fees from the protocols along with the PNL from trading. It’s difficult to benchmark the performance of these vaults against each other as the TVL deposited in both has been constantly changing over the last few months.But Megavault estimates annual pay based on the previous months returns annualised (which is -7% right now) & using the same methodology HLP estimate would be (-9.2% - No thanks to the Hyperliquid whale)I think the vault that outperforms is the one with more trading volumes over a long enough time frame. The protocol with more trading volume/TVL ratio gets to earn more from trading fees with the trading returns across both platforms converging over time unless the MMing strategy is significantly different (which I doubt it is).
